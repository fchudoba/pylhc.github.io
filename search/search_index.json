Middle Button : Auto-zoom (in 3 Steps: 4\u03c3, 3\u03c3, 2\u03c3). Right Button : Undo last step. Shift + Right Button : Undo all steps (reset plot). Mouse Wheel : Zoom relative to mouse position. Shift + Mouse Wheel : Zoom y-axis relative to mouse position. Alt + Mouse Wheel : Zoom relative to plot center. Shift + Alt + Mouse Wheel : Zoom y-axis relative to plot center. Nattune Updater \u00b6 You can set a frequency range and it does not redo the analysis but just picks the highest peak in that range and assigns it to NATTUNE in the lin-file.

The user can choose tasks to do for each IP . The AutoTrim then executes all the trimming tasks and analyzing tasks in the best order possible to optimize the process. The user can input parameters once to do the k-modulation and other analysis tasks on many IP 's. The results and current status of each process is displayed on the main panel. The AutoTrim provides something like a pipeline of many k-modulations and their analyzing tasks. First Time AutoTrim If you are in the CCC and have never used the AutoTrim before, follow these steps: Open the AutoTrimDialog by clicking on the AutoTim button located on the left side of the main panel. Add the IPs you want to trim or analyze with the buttons on the left side. Input the trim parameter or load an existing trim for each IP tab. Select the analyzing options you want to execute. Input the needed values for the trim and all the optional tasks. Once everything is set up, right press the Start button and select the directory where to save the results (It will save the results depending on the trim time and IP . See wiki for more information). The AutoTrim will now check if the orbit feedback is on and the tune feedback is off. Make sure to put them in the desired state. The ResultsView will open and the AutoTrim gets started. AutoTrim Panel \u00b6 The InputPanel \u00b6 This input panel provides all the options to set every parameter for k-modulation. On the left panel the user can choose which IP to trim or analyze. Depending on the parameters, the panel will show input panels for the specific IPs: each panel has a top bar with optional tasks that can be executed after the trim as well as an input field for the current energy. The energy value is gathered live from the LHC, but can be edited. Underneath is another tabbed pane for each task in the current process which needs some user input. The AutoTrim input panel. By pressing the start button, it will ask the user for the save directory and then starts the AutoTrim process. AutoTrim will then create a result folder for each IP , open the ResultsView on the main panel and start the pipeline of processes. The chosen save directory is the root directory. The AutoTrim will then create a subdirectory for each IP where the result files are stored. In principle, this will perform a full IP trim for all of the selected IPs and planes. For more details, see the full IP trim section. The ResultsView \u00b6 The ResultsView is the main panel of an AutoTrim process. It is built as a tabbed pane which holds the content of the processes for many IPs and displays information such as process status, results, etc. The status panel and the result panel are the main components for each process. The ResultsView. At the top is a thread queue bar which displays all the active, finished and scheduled threads. The thread queue of the results view. Tip By double-clicking on the IP label of the tabbed pane its possible to extract the IP panel in another frame. It will snap back to the tabbed pane if it gets closed by the user. The Status Panel \u00b6 The status panel shows information about the current process, with the currently running task is displayed at the top. The user can click through the list of tasks to see start/end time, input parameters, log entries, and the current status. There is also a panel for the input parameter of thes current task. This has to be done in the actual task code since the view doesn't have a reference to the task. The last panel is the logger text area for each task. Per default, it will show the last logging entry with the corresponding time, but the user can expand the list by clicking on the drop-down button. The AutoTrim Status Panel.

There, one can only select the trim entries depending on the IP of the tab. Selecting any trim you want with the Trim-Selection panel, which will then add the selected trims as tabs to the AutoTrim panel. Load a trim directly to an AutoTrim-Tab \u00b6 Start by creating your IP tab by clicking on the button on the left side: tick the Load existing trim checkbox and it will open the trim selection panel. AutoTrim: load existing trim. Expand the date picker and choose the day when the trim was executed. Left click on the trim you want to load and press the Select trim button.

To discard the loaded trim and proceed with the Full IP Trim instead, untick the Load existing trim checkbox. The Trim-Selection Panel \u00b6 The Trim-Selection panel will add the selected trim data as tabs to the AutoTrim panel. It also provides some basic options to apply to every tab, such as setting analyzing the orbit to default. This might be the best option if you want to reanalyze many trims with the same model. Open this panel by pressing the Load Trims button located on the bottom center of the AutoTrim panel. Filter the Timber entries by IP and date, then select the trim entries in the Search Results panel and press the green Add selected trim button. The trims are now selected and displayed in the Selected Trims panel. By clicking on confirm the tabs will be added to the AutoTrim panel. You can now set some basic options for the selected trims in the Options pane. These values are automatically set as preset values for the loaded trim tabs. The AutoTrim Trim Selection Wizard. Simulation Mode \u00b6 The kmod application provides two different modes to execute all its functionality: The Measurement mode , which is the standard mode and should be used in the control center to gather real data from the LHC. The Simulation mode , which only simulates these live measurements. If you start a normal trim task in Simulation mode the AutoTrim will load the last trim data from timber. This data is then displayed like a normal trim during a live measurement. The energy value is not automatically loaded from Timber, and uses a preset value of 6500.0 GeV. The AutoTrim won't check if the Orbit and Tune feedback is on or off. Analyzing a Trim \u00b6 Input Tab \u00b6 This input tab is separated into two sides, one for each existing beam in the LHC. One side holds the input fields for all needed parameters in order to run the beta star analysis script. It is also possible to provide only one estimated beta star value as input by ticking the Use round optics option. This checkbox will disable the input for the beta star in the vertical plane and uses the horizontal input for both.

We will be creating a new account, so you do not have to add the password of your main account to your Gitlab repository : this would be a security risk! Admittedly, it is a low one if everything is done correctly, but just in case something goes wrong or leaks, you can just delete this account . Also, you can give this account only the rights necessary to write to AFS in the first place and do not risk that anyone can access other sensible information. 1. Create a new service account, via the CERN account management , of length 8. You need at least 8 characters to mask that name in Gitlab (if you want to do so), but on the other hand, there is a warning, that AFS cannot handle names longer than 8. So exactly 8 seems to be the sweetspot. If you do not care about masking the name (it is not as important as masking the password, see below) you can go shorter. 2. Set a password of length \u2265 8 containing only [a-zA-Z0-9+/@:] . We want to hide the password later in gitlab, and this is only possible if its >= 8 characters long and only contains Base64 characters as well as @: . You can go as long as you want. Better make this 15 characters long at least. 3. Activate the AFS service for the newly created account. Setup AFS folder \u00b6 Steps to be done on AFS : 4. Clone your git into your AFS destination. It is important here to you use the right link to set this up, depending on whether you want your repository to be private or public. Go to your Gitlab repository page and click onto the blue clone button on the right. If it is okay for your repo to be publicly accessible you can use the HTTPS url. If you want to set it up privately you will need to clone with the KRB5 url, so Kerberos can be later used to authenticate your service account. ( See also below for giving it rights to the repository.) 5. Run: find . -type d -exec fs sa {} ACCOUNTNAME rlidw \\; Run within the repository or replace . with the repository name! Replace ACCOUNTNAME with the name of your Service Account. This will give read/write access to this repository to the service account. Just giving these rights to the top-folder will not work, as it does not propagate to subfolders automatically. A possible other way would be to create an empty folder and give writing rights to that one to the service account and then login to lxplus with the service account and clone the repository directly with that account. The latter is a good test to see if everything worked correctly anyway. Do not forget, if you have set up the repository with Kerberos authentification, to adapt your .ssh/config to delegate the credentials.

However, the returned values are often off by a certain factor called calibration factor. Knowledge of calibration factors can be used to increase the accuracy of measurements. There are currently two methods to determine BPM calibration factors, using either the ratio between the dispersion or the \\(\\beta\\) -functions computed from phase and from amplitude. A special type of optics called Ballistic Optics have been designed for the measurement of calibration factors. The most efficient way to get those factors is via an undisturbed function, i.e. in a drift by turning off quadrupoles, creating a standard drift space between BPMs. Calibration for Ballistic Optics The computation of BPM calibration factors is only done for ballistic optics and their related BPMs because the \\(\\beta\\) -function and dispersion are known in such drifts. Fitting \\(\\beta\\) -Functions The \\(\\beta\\) -function and dispersion can also be fitted (parabolic and linear) to get more precise values. The \\(\\beta\\) -function and dispersion are fitted between a set of BPMs defined by the ballistic optics. The list of used BPMs can be found in the code, defined in the calibration constants . For the dispersion, those BPMs are located between the separation dipoles, where the dispersion propagates linearly.

However, the returned values are often off by a certain factor called calibration factor. Knowledge of calibration factors can be used to increase the accuracy of measurements. There are currently two methods to determine BPM calibration factors, using either the ratio between the dispersion or the \\(\\beta\\) -functions computed from phase and from amplitude. A special type of optics called Ballistic Optics have been designed for the measurement of calibration factors. The most efficient way to get those factors is via an undisturbed function, i.e. in a drift by turning off quadrupoles, creating a standard drift space between BPMs. Calibration for Ballistic Optics The computation of BPM calibration factors is only done for ballistic optics and their related BPMs because the \\(\\beta\\) -function and dispersion are known in such drifts. Fitting \\(\\beta\\) -Functions The \\(\\beta\\) -function and dispersion can also be fitted (parabolic and linear) to get more precise values. The \\(\\beta\\) -function and dispersion are fitted between a set of BPMs defined by the ballistic optics. The list of used BPMs can be found in the code, defined in the calibration constants . For the dispersion, those BPMs are located between the separation dipoles, where the dispersion propagates linearly.","title":"BPM Calibration"},{"location":"measurements/physics/bpm_calibration/#calibration-from-the-function","text":"The calibration factors based off the \\(\\beta\\) -functions from amplitude and from phase, \\(\\beta^A\\) and \\(\\beta^\\phi\\) , are defined as: \\[ C^A_{x,y} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\beta^\\phi_{x,y}}{\\beta^A_{x,y}}} \\] It is important to note that the \\(\\beta\\) -function is proportional to the square of the particles' amplitude.

The Procedure in Short The basis of this measurement is to kick with increasing amplitude in a single plane and perform fits over the resulting tune shifts. To assure a good direct and cross detuning measurement, it is important to check that both natural tune lines (for the horizontal and vertical tune) are visible in the respective spectrum. It is of utmost importance for the detuning analysis to perform rigorous cleaning on the data. Measurement \u00b6 Preparations \u00b6 Confirm machine state Make sure that the configuration of the machine is as you expect it. Perform the general checks Check correct \\(\\beta^*\\) Check correct crossing angles Check collimation sequence \"LOAD COARSE SETTINGS FOR NLO AT 30 CM\" is the current (run 3, 2022) collimation sequence for AC-Dipole kicks in the LHC at \\(\\beta^*\\) = 30cm up to \u00b1170\u03bcrad IP1-V/IP5-H crossing and \u00b1150\u03bcrad IP1-H, \u2212150\u03bcrad to +140\u03bcrad IP5-V separation. Correct Coupling As always, coupling should be well corrected to \\(|C-| \\approx 10^{-3}\\) . This can be easily achieved by performing diagonal kicks of intermediate strength, and get the correction values from the GUI. Beware that the signs need to be switched for correction in the machine . Do initial measurement Start with a low AC-Dipole amplitude in both planes (e.g. 5%\u221210%) and analyse the resulting data. Check both Natural Tunes are visible Perform a quick harmonic analysis on the resulting data and check the spectrum. Both natural tunes need to be visible in their respective plane for the majority of BPMs. If not, maybe try to adapt the tune delta and move the driven tunes closer to the natural ones. See Info-box \"Tune Deltas\" below. Bad Spectrum. Good Spectrum. Repeat until the spectrum looks usable Tune Deltas In the past, clean amplitude detuning measurements could be achieved with tune deltas (signs as given in Multiturn) of Horizontal: -0.009, Vertical: +0.007. Actual Measurement \u00b6 When kicking with crossing angles When kicking with the crossing orbit bump in, make sure at each kick, that the losses occur in IP6/IP7 and not in the IPs with the crossing in (usually IP1 and IP5)! Losses in these IPs can appear with minor amplitude change, so keep the amplitude increase between kicks small . If you see losses in the IPs with crossing angles, but you are not yet happy with your maximum amplitude and you still have a lot of beam intensity left, you can kick at the same amplitude a few times and hope that the losses go down (the outermost particles are scraped) and then (carefully) continue increasing amplitude again. Kicks in the vertical plane While keeping the AC-Dipole amplitude in the horizontal plane constant (but not zero, to avoid weird AC-Dipole behaviour and to see if there is coupling effects), slowly increase the amplitude in the vertical plane. Kick with slowly increasing amplitude (1% - 5% increase between kicks) Check losses are low during each kick Adapt amplitude increase accordingly, as you do not want to dump the beam because the losses were to high. Also check the beam intensity, you will want to have good intensity if there are more detuning measurements in the other planes/settings to do. When kicking with crossing: head the warning above! Losses may occur with only a small amplitude increase! Check for tune drift If you are kicking with reduced tune deltas, it is also important to have an eye on the tune drift of the machine, so that you do not further decrease the distance between natural tune and excitation. Update the tune in Multiturn if necessary. The tune drifts will be compensated in the python analysis step by using data from the BBQ. Try to reach 0.015\u03bcm - 0.020\u03bcm in action ( \\(2J_x\\) ) Get around 15 - 20 kicks Kicks in the horizontal plane While keeping the AC-Dipole amplitude in the vertical plane constant (but not zero, to avoid weird AC-Dipole behaviour and to see if there is coupling effects), slowly increase the amplitude in the horizontal plane. Kick with slowly increasing amplitude (1% - 5% increase between kicks) Check losses are low during each kick Adapt amplitude increase accordingly, as you do not want to dump the beam because the losses were to high.

Try to reach 0.015\u03bcm - 0.020\u03bcm in action ( \\(2J_y\\) ) Get around 15 - 20 kicks Diagonal Kicks (optional) To increase the accuracy of the cross-term measurement, 2D kicks (and 3.5D fitting) can be performed. If this is desired, it makes sense to throw some diagonal kicks, i.e. kicks with (more or less, not too important for the fitting) equal amplitude into the mix. Kick with slowly increasing amplitude (1% - 5% increase between kicks) Check losses are low during each kick Adapt amplitude increase accordingly, as you do not want to dump the beam because the losses were to high.

Otherwise it can always be checked running optics analysis on a file and looking into the Optics \u2192 Action/Tune tab or the kick-file. Analysis \u00b6 The analysis described here is performed with the Beta-Beat GUI omc3-v0.1.1 , python package omc3 v0.4.0 . Earlier versions can analyse detuning as well, but some of the functionality described here is missing or a bit buggy, e.g. in these versions the 2D-detuning analysis was newly implemented, as well as the Auto Clean functionality, and the BBQ correction uses the wrong variable names. It is therefore recommended to use these or newer versions. The analysis of amplitude detuning data requires very accurate estimates of the natural tunes, which can be hard to find if they get lost in the BPM noise or when they are close to resonances in the spectrum. Multiple features have been implemented in python and GUI to ease the detuning analysis. As the main steps follow the standard optics analysis, the entries described here are mostly hints and tricks on how to optimize the analysis and only need to be applied where necessary. Load Data Simply load the data in the BPM panel. Make sure you are loading the correct data and check the logbook for misfired kicks etc. Run Spectral Analysis A bad spectral analysis can be recovered by the steps mentioned in \"Cleaning\", but a good frequency spectrum and well found natural tunes will save you a lot of time later on. Small tolerance (\u224810 \u22123 ) The tune tolerance (found in the Tune Settings ) specifies in what region around the assumed natural tune (see next step, the region is \\(f\\) \u00b1 tolerance), the highest frequency line is chosen to be the natural tune. To not accidentally capture the main tune or other excited resonances close by, the tolerance should be kept low (\u224810 \u22123 ). In case of large detuning (e.g. 40 \u00b7 10 3 m \u22121 \u00d7 0.016m = 6.4 \u00b7 10 \u22123 ) or change of the AC-Dipole frequency (e.g. to adapt for tune drifts), this could mean that the natural tune will not fall into this window anymore. Both can be avoided using Autotunes and maybe adapting the tune deltas (see next step), but can also be easily remedied in the cleaning step via the Update Nattune functionality. You can check the approximate tolerance window, by using the Set Window button of Update Nattune , which will set the markers according to the Nattune and tolerance in the Tune Settings , which might differ a bit from the actual window if Autotunes are used. Tune settings. Approximate tolerance window, shown in blue for the horizontal and in red for the vertical tune. Use Autotunes and Nat. Deltas In case the tunes do not coincide with the model, e.g. due to tune-drifts, we might run into problems when using a small tolerance (see previous step) as the natural tune might now be outside of the search window. One way to remedy that would be to also keep the model tunes up-to-date, e.g. use the exact tune values from the kick entries in the logbook. The one thing that should be constant during the measurement process though, are the tune deltas. The easiest way therefore, to make sure that at least the non-detuned tune is in the tolerance window, is to use the Autotunes in the Tune Settings : If this is activated (here for transverse planes), the highest peak in the whole spectrum is automatically assumed to be the driven tune. From those we can specify the difference to the natural tunes, by activating the Nat. Deltas , instead of the natural tunes themselves. Now, no matter the tune drift (if the tunes are kept updated in Multiturn), the unperturbed natural tune should always be, where we expect it. Beware that the signs between the Nat. Deltas and Multiturn are inverted, as Multiturn uses the \u0394 to specify the excitation frequency based on the natural tune, while the GUI/harpy searches for the natural tune at \u0394 from the driven tune. Tune settings. Good Frequency Resolution ( TurnBits > 15 ) As the tune shift can be very small, we would want a good resolution in frequency, which can be controlled by TurnBits . The standard value of TurnBits of 20 (leading to 2 20 complex coefficients, i.e. 2 21 spectral lines) is a good start, but can lead to excessive memory use when analysing 15\u221220 files at once. I estimate (from experience), that with 19 turn-bits, you will need 60GB to 80GB of RAM, 20 will obviously double and 18 halve that value. Both of these should be good values to use (see Infobox \"TurnBit Estimation\" below). The OutputBits on the other hand can be smaller, as the highest line stored per \"bucket\" will keep the frequency location calculated from the higher resolution form TurnBits . Therefore, even if the wrong line is selected (see step \"Small tolerance\"), the correct tune line will still be available in its bucket. The only issue would be, if there is a resonance really close by. A value of 10 - 12 (0.5 \u00b7 10 \u22124 - 10 \u22124 tune units) should be enough, to keep the file-size manageable and allow to open all the files simultaneously in the GUI. Check and Clean Data As mentioned before, it is of utmost importance to have clean data for the analysis as otherwise the fit will not work and yield unreasonable results. In principle each file needs to be checked that all BPMs point to the correct horizontal and vertical natural tunes, and cleaned appropriately. The following steps can be applied to recover the right natural tunes, if visible in the spectrum, limit error-bars and clean outliers. Check Time and Space for NATTUNEX and NATTUNEY For the amplitude detuning analysis, the most important factor is the correct determination of the natural tunes. When the harpy frequency analysis is done, one can check the found tunes in the Analysis Panel in the Time and Space tab. Make sure to select NATTUNEX and NATTUNEY not just the main tunes. Be sure that the found tune shown is the natural tune and not the driven tune. Often it is required to check only one of them at a time, to get a clearer view. This can be easily achieved by right clicking into the data selection box on the left hand side of the plane that you want to unselect (or choosing none ) and then middle clicking into the chart to auto-zoom the data. The BPMs should differ only very little in the found tune (< 10 \u22125 ), otherwise they need to be cleaned. The following steps describe how to do that. Example of NATTUNEX data with outliers. Example for clean (but not perfect) NATTUNEX data. Check Frequency Chart In case of differences in the found tunes of the BPMs, the first check should always be the Frequency Chart in the adjacent tab of the Analysis Panel . Especially, if there are clusters of found frequencies (i.e half of the BPMs agree on one frequency, the other half on another) in the Time and Space Chart , this hints at resonance lines close by that are mistaken for the natural tune. In any case, one needs to manually identify which of the lines within the selected tolerance (see in one of the analysis steps above) is the actual tune. If it is not clear at first glance, compare the spectrum of the current kick with previous kicks to see the natural tune evolution with increasing amplitude. Once the right tune is identified - or determined of being not present in the spectrum - one of the next steps can be applied. Very helpful when trying to identify where the currently found natural tune is located in the Frequency Spectrum , is to activate the Resonance Lines and select Nat. Tune (Measured) , which shows the average natural tunes of all BPMs (of the first selected analysis data). Show the natural tune in the frequency spectum. Update natural tune window (where applicable) If the correct natural tune is visible in the spectrum but could not be identified properly, due to resonance lines close by or because the line lies outside of the tolerance window, one does not have to repeat the analysis with adapted tunes, deltas and tolerance window, as needs to be done when using the python2 GUI, but can use the Update Lin-File functionality: Select the BPMs you want to update.

Clean wrong BPMs (where applicable) If updating the natural tune window from the last step is not sufficient (e.g. if the tune line is hidden in noise), the respective BPMs should be removed. Data can be manually cleaned by using the Clean functionality: Set the cursors around the data that you want to keep and Clean . Or one can use the Auto Clean functionality, which removes all outliers based on a gaussian distribution of the points until all points either lie inside the given limit or no points are beyond an automatically determined (by the number of points) range. In both cases, the majority of the BPMs should already agree on the natural tune and any cleaning step can be undone, either separately in X and Y or int both planes. Auto Clean and Undo example. Clean wrong Measurements (where applicable) If the measurement is just very noisy and the natural tune can not be recovered using the Update Lin-File or cleaning methods described above, it might be best to remove the measurement completely. If rigorous kicks have been performed, this might not be dramatic. In case one plane has resulted in a nice measurement, but the other not so much, this measurement might need to be manually cleaned in the Kick File after optics analysis, see in the later step. Run combined Optics Analysis After all measurements are satisfyingly cleaned, the optics analysis ( Get Optics ) can be run on all measurements combined , so that they end up all in the same folder in the same Kick File (per plane). Give the analysis a nice name, identifying what kind of measurement you are doing (e.g. b1_ampdet_vertical_30cm_with_xing ). Final Cleaning in Kick-Files After the optics analysis has run, the only input from it that is needed for the detuning analysis are the Kick-Files . In fact, these are the only files required to be present in the folder given as input to the python omc3.amplitude_detuning_analysis script. In the case discussed above, that for one kick one wants to keep one tune plane but not the other, one can now open the respective kick_x or kick_y file and set the natural tune entry (e.g. NATTUNEX ) for that kick to NaN . That way, this tune measurement will be ignored. If you delete the whole line of the kick, you also remove the action data, which is needed to calculate the cross-term for this kick. You would therefore also erase that datapoint, even though the measurement was fine. Run Amplitude Detuning Analysis To run the amplitude detuning analysis, go in the Optics Panel to the Action/Tune Tab and select the optics analysis data. The GUI already allows for a quick check, if the data looks okay, e.g. no immensely large error-bars, outliers, etc. A quick and simple fit can already be performed here, with the slope being output in the logging line at the bottom. To start the python analysis, click Python Detuning Analysis . In the Amplitude Detuning Analysis window make sure that the right Action Plane for your kicks is selected. Choose XY for the 2D/4D analysis. Also make sure, that the tick at AC-Dipole is set, which will compensate the direct terms for the forced oscillations (i.e. divide the detuning by a factor of 2) in the plots. The analysis from the GUI is usually run with BBQ correction, which can be deactivated by choosing this option in the BBQ Filtering Method (it does not make sense to use the BBQ data without filtering first, therefore no filtering = no BBQ correction). Clicking on Start runs the amplitude detuning python script on the current optics data and - if this is successful - also runs the plotting functions for the results (and the BBQ, if this function was not deactivated). This plotting is also done in python , resulting in matplotlib windows to pop up and plot.ampdet_dQ*d2J*.pdf files to appear in the optics result directory. The amplitude detuning analysis window. With BBQ correction To account for any tune drifts of the machine during the measurement, the tune data is corrected by the data from the BBQ. As this data is very noisy (and contains the outliers from the AC-Dipole excitation), it needs to be cleaned first. A moving average of the given Window length is used determining a tune estimation over the kick timerange. This data is extracted from timber and saved into a bbq_ampdet.tfs file in the optics results folder. So in case you run the same detuning analysis again, but maybe want to modify the BBQ cleaning parameters, this data can be re-used by ticking Use previous BBQ . The first cleaning method outliers is using the same algorithm as Auto Clean , and requires an outlier limit to be set. BBQ data deviating less than this limit from the moving average are never cleaned. The moving average is then calculated on the cleaned data and the closest value to the kick time subtracted from the natural tune measured during the kick. The second method cut allows to choose a fixed cut around the assumed natural tunes and data beyond that value is cleaned. In this case also Fine windowing can be enabled, which performs another moving average on the now cleaned data and data-points deviating more than the fine cut value are also cleaned. Quick TurnBit Estimation Let's assume a small detuning of 10 \u00b7 10 3 m \u22121 and an action increase between kicks of 0.020 \u03bcm / 20 kicks, leading to a detuning difference between two kicks of \u0394Q = 1 \u00b7 10 \u22125 . The frequency resolution \\(\\Delta f\\) is the inverse of the length of the turns-data (halved, as we have pairs), so 2 \u2212TurnBits\u22121 : TurnBits = 20 : \\(\\Delta f = 4.8 \\cdot 10^{-7}\\) TurnBits = 19 : \\(\\Delta f = 9.5 \\cdot 10^{-7}\\) TurnBits = 18 : \\(\\Delta f = 1.9 \\cdot 10^{-6}\\) TurnBits = 17 : \\(\\Delta f = 3.8 \\cdot 10^{-6}\\) TurnBits = 16 : \\(\\Delta f = 7.6 \\cdot 10^{-6}\\) TurnBits = 15 : \\(\\Delta f = 1.5 \\cdot 10^{-5}\\) We therefore need to set TurnBits to at least 16 to assure that we will see the change \u0394Q between kicks.","title":"Amplitude Detuning"},{"location":"measurements/procedures/ampdet/#amplitude-detuning-measurements","text":"Note Please keep in mind the general checks for measurements. The Procedure in Short The basis of this measurement is to kick with increasing amplitude in a single plane and perform fits over the resulting tune shifts.

Losses in these IPs can appear with minor amplitude change, so keep the amplitude increase between kicks small . If you see losses in the IPs with crossing angles, but you are not yet happy with your maximum amplitude and you still have a lot of beam intensity left, you can kick at the same amplitude a few times and hope that the losses go down (the outermost particles are scraped) and then (carefully) continue increasing amplitude again.

Earlier versions can analyse detuning as well, but some of the functionality described here is missing or a bit buggy, e.g. in these versions the 2D-detuning analysis was newly implemented, as well as the Auto Clean functionality, and the BBQ correction uses the wrong variable names. It is therefore recommended to use these or newer versions. The analysis of amplitude detuning data requires very accurate estimates of the natural tunes, which can be hard to find if they get lost in the BPM noise or when they are close to resonances in the spectrum. Multiple features have been implemented in python and GUI to ease the detuning analysis. As the main steps follow the standard optics analysis, the entries described here are mostly hints and tricks on how to optimize the analysis and only need to be applied where necessary. Load Data Simply load the data in the BPM panel. Make sure you are loading the correct data and check the logbook for misfired kicks etc. Run Spectral Analysis A bad spectral analysis can be recovered by the steps mentioned in \"Cleaning\", but a good frequency spectrum and well found natural tunes will save you a lot of time later on. Small tolerance (\u224810 \u22123 ) The tune tolerance (found in the Tune Settings ) specifies in what region around the assumed natural tune (see next step, the region is \\(f\\) \u00b1 tolerance), the highest frequency line is chosen to be the natural tune. To not accidentally capture the main tune or other excited resonances close by, the tolerance should be kept low (\u224810 \u22123 ). In case of large detuning (e.g. 40 \u00b7 10 3 m \u22121 \u00d7 0.016m = 6.4 \u00b7 10 \u22123 ) or change of the AC-Dipole frequency (e.g. to adapt for tune drifts), this could mean that the natural tune will not fall into this window anymore. Both can be avoided using Autotunes and maybe adapting the tune deltas (see next step), but can also be easily remedied in the cleaning step via the Update Nattune functionality. You can check the approximate tolerance window, by using the Set Window button of Update Nattune , which will set the markers according to the Nattune and tolerance in the Tune Settings , which might differ a bit from the actual window if Autotunes are used. Tune settings. Approximate tolerance window, shown in blue for the horizontal and in red for the vertical tune. Use Autotunes and Nat. Deltas In case the tunes do not coincide with the model, e.g. due to tune-drifts, we might run into problems when using a small tolerance (see previous step) as the natural tune might now be outside of the search window. One way to remedy that would be to also keep the model tunes up-to-date, e.g. use the exact tune values from the kick entries in the logbook. The one thing that should be constant during the measurement process though, are the tune deltas. The easiest way therefore, to make sure that at least the non-detuned tune is in the tolerance window, is to use the Autotunes in the Tune Settings : If this is activated (here for transverse planes), the highest peak in the whole spectrum is automatically assumed to be the driven tune. From those we can specify the difference to the natural tunes, by activating the Nat. Deltas , instead of the natural tunes themselves. Now, no matter the tune drift (if the tunes are kept updated in Multiturn), the unperturbed natural tune should always be, where we expect it. Beware that the signs between the Nat. Deltas and Multiturn are inverted, as Multiturn uses the \u0394 to specify the excitation frequency based on the natural tune, while the GUI/harpy searches for the natural tune at \u0394 from the driven tune. Tune settings. Good Frequency Resolution ( TurnBits > 15 ) As the tune shift can be very small, we would want a good resolution in frequency, which can be controlled by TurnBits . The standard value of TurnBits of 20 (leading to 2 20 complex coefficients, i.e. 2 21 spectral lines) is a good start, but can lead to excessive memory use when analysing 15\u221220 files at once. I estimate (from experience), that with 19 turn-bits, you will need 60GB to 80GB of RAM, 20 will obviously double and 18 halve that value. Both of these should be good values to use (see Infobox \"TurnBit Estimation\" below). The OutputBits on the other hand can be smaller, as the highest line stored per \"bucket\" will keep the frequency location calculated from the higher resolution form TurnBits . Therefore, even if the wrong line is selected (see step \"Small tolerance\"), the correct tune line will still be available in its bucket. The only issue would be, if there is a resonance really close by. A value of 10 - 12 (0.5 \u00b7 10 \u22124 - 10 \u22124 tune units) should be enough, to keep the file-size manageable and allow to open all the files simultaneously in the GUI. Check and Clean Data As mentioned before, it is of utmost importance to have clean data for the analysis as otherwise the fit will not work and yield unreasonable results. In principle each file needs to be checked that all BPMs point to the correct horizontal and vertical natural tunes, and cleaned appropriately. The following steps can be applied to recover the right natural tunes, if visible in the spectrum, limit error-bars and clean outliers. Check Time and Space for NATTUNEX and NATTUNEY For the amplitude detuning analysis, the most important factor is the correct determination of the natural tunes. When the harpy frequency analysis is done, one can check the found tunes in the Analysis Panel in the Time and Space tab. Make sure to select NATTUNEX and NATTUNEY not just the main tunes. Be sure that the found tune shown is the natural tune and not the driven tune. Often it is required to check only one of them at a time, to get a clearer view. This can be easily achieved by right clicking into the data selection box on the left hand side of the plane that you want to unselect (or choosing none ) and then middle clicking into the chart to auto-zoom the data. The BPMs should differ only very little in the found tune (< 10 \u22125 ), otherwise they need to be cleaned. The following steps describe how to do that. Example of NATTUNEX data with outliers. Example for clean (but not perfect) NATTUNEX data. Check Frequency Chart In case of differences in the found tunes of the BPMs, the first check should always be the Frequency Chart in the adjacent tab of the Analysis Panel . Especially, if there are clusters of found frequencies (i.e half of the BPMs agree on one frequency, the other half on another) in the Time and Space Chart , this hints at resonance lines close by that are mistaken for the natural tune. In any case, one needs to manually identify which of the lines within the selected tolerance (see in one of the analysis steps above) is the actual tune. If it is not clear at first glance, compare the spectrum of the current kick with previous kicks to see the natural tune evolution with increasing amplitude. Once the right tune is identified - or determined of being not present in the spectrum - one of the next steps can be applied. Very helpful when trying to identify where the currently found natural tune is located in the Frequency Spectrum , is to activate the Resonance Lines and select Nat. Tune (Measured) , which shows the average natural tunes of all BPMs (of the first selected analysis data). Show the natural tune in the frequency spectum. Update natural tune window (where applicable) If the correct natural tune is visible in the spectrum but could not be identified properly, due to resonance lines close by or because the line lies outside of the tolerance window, one does not have to repeat the analysis with adapted tunes, deltas and tolerance window, as needs to be done when using the python2 GUI, but can use the Update Lin-File functionality: Select the BPMs you want to update. If you want to update only one plane deselect ( right click into the data selection box or choose none ) all BPMs in the other plane. If you want to update all BPMs in one plane, use Ctrl + a in the data of the plane you want to select. (Minimize the legend first...)

Turn Off the Landau Octupoles Unless you specifically need them on for your measurements (ampdet & co). These are the MO elements. Correct the Machine Chromaticity to a Few Units In the past we've used \\(2\\) , which we will most likely keep using in Run 3. Mask the ATLAS BCM This status should be visible in the Multiturn application (better check still). The only way to change this setting is by contacting the ATLAS control room. See with the EIC to get in touch. Check the AC Dipole Keys Are In Or MKA if that's used. Make Sure the Collimators Are Open There should be a pre-made setting for this. Timing Tables Normally, starting in Run 3 the timing tables are automatically loaded by the Multiturn application.

The Procedure in Short This methods aims to find the MQSX correction settings that would minimize betatron coupling and its impact on beam size at the IP . The method breaks the symmetry of the optics in the IR and forces local coupling RDTs to leak throughout the machine, which makes them measurable through the \\(|C^{-}|\\) . After global corrections are done and trimmed in the machine, one applies a rigid waist shift in a given IR and scans the colinearity knob for the value that minimizes the \\(|C^{-}|\\) . These settings, when taking away the rigid waist shift , will minimize local coupling and its impact at the IP . Additional info can be found in Felix's 2021 IPAC paper 1 . Rigid Waist Shift & LSA Knobs \u00b6 Some information about the rigid waist shift can be found in this gallery page from Felix's package's documentation. Some details about the creation of these knobs and their addition in LSA can be found in this LHC OMC logbook entry and the ones that follow. Knob Setting Convention \u00b6 Two different knobs are used for the waist shift that need to be trimmed in: The triplets knob, which generates the waist shift itself. The independent quadrupoles knob (Q4 - Q10), which re-matches the optics. The unit setting of the triplet knob is an arbitrary definition, where a value of \\(\\pm1\\) corresponds to a \\(\\pm 0.5\\) % change of the triplet powering, which leads to a waist shift of ~43-44cm in a given direction, for the \\(\\beta^{*} = 30cm\\) optics. The knob setting is defined as follows, with regards to Beam1 (reverse for Beam2): Unit setting of + \\(1\\) : shifts the waist to the left of the IP ( \\(s_{waist}^{B1} < s_{IP}^{B1}\\) ) Unit setting of - \\(1\\) : shifts the waist to the right of the IP ( \\(s_{waist}^{B1} > s_{IP}^{B1}\\) ) The Knobs in LSA \u00b6 Since the triplet knob for a unit setting of + \\(1\\) is the exact opposite magnet powering of the knob for a unit setting of - \\(1\\) , only a single triplet knob per IP has been added to LSA , which can then be trimmed with a factor of \\(\\pm1\\) . On the other hand, the re-matching quadrupole knobs are specific to a given direction of the shift, so two of them per IP (one per direction) were added to LSA , with the pos and neg suffixes. These should always be trimmed with a factor of \\(1\\) . As a consequence, respect the following rules when applying the knobs below: When trimming the triplet knob with a factor of + \\(1\\) , use the pos re-matching quadrupoles knob. When trimming the triplet knob with a factor of - \\(1\\) , use the neg re-matching quadrupoles knob.

To do so we need to apply the LHCBEAM/MD_ATS_2020-05_04_BX_RigidWaistShift_Triplet_IP1 with a factor of + \\(1\\) . Since we used a + \\(1\\) factor on the triplet knob, the corresponding re-matching quadrupoles knobs to use are those with the pos suffix, and they should be trimmed with a factor + \\(1\\) . The knobs to trim are then: LHCBEAM/MD_ATS_2022_05_04_B1_RigidWaitsShift_IP1pos and LHCBEAM/MD_ATS_2022_05_04_B2_RigidWaitsShift_IP1pos . Value of the Waist Shift The waist shift from the generated knobs should be of about 43 to 44cm in either direction. In operation in the machine, it is likely that the optics aren't perfect and already present a small waist shift, which would add on top of the one generated by these knobs. This means one should expect the waists left and right to be slightly un-symmetric. Preliminary Setup \u00b6 Do Global Corrections This procedure needs global corrections to be trimmed in the machine first, so optics and global coupling should be taken care of beforehand. Optional: Scan the Colinearity Knob to Check Conditions If time allows, ideally we would scan the colinearity knob to ensure we see very small variations of the \\(|C^{-}|\\) . If strong variations are noticed, then the expected conditions for the procedure are not met: either the phase advance between left and right MQSXs is off, or the \\(\\sqrt{\\beta_x \\beta_y}\\) is significantly wrong at these elements. Procedure Per IP \u00b6 This procedure is applied at the main experimental insertions (IR1 and IR5) where local corrections need to be established or checked. Keep in mind that this does Beam1 and Beam2 at the same time, but different IPs cannot / should not be done in parallel. Orbit & Tune Feedbacks These feedbacks should be kept ON during the trim of the knobs and the procedure. Trim in the Waist Shift Knob Trim the prepared knob in the machine, for a certain direction (waist left/right of the IP ). Remember that this affects both beams at the same time. On can take a few measurements to assess the impact of the optics. Trim in the Corresponding Optics Re-Matching Knobs See the Knobs in LSA section to determine which knobs to apply. At this point one should also kick a few times and ensure the optics were re-matched properly. Take a Reference Measurement Do some kicks and measure \\(|C^{-}|\\) and the optics. This will serve as a baseline reference of the coupling in the machine without any colinearity knob applied. Scan the Colinearity Knob Trim the colinearity knob , about one or two units at a time depending on the range of values you want to cover. For each setting, do some kicks and measure the \\(|C^{-}|\\) and the optics. Go Back to Nominal Machine Trim out the rigid waist shift , and ensure that no drift from nominal is observed. If needed, do another round of global corrections. Trim in the Opposite Waist Shift Knob Trim the prepared knob in the machine, for the other direction (waist right/left of the IP ). On can take a few measurements to assess the impact of the optics. Trim in the Corresponding Optics Re-Matching Knobs See the Knobs in LSA section to determine which knobs to apply. At this point one should also kick a few times and ensure the optics were re-matched properly. Take a Reference Measurement Do some kicks and measure \\(|C^{-}|\\) and the optics. This will serve as a baseline reference of the coupling in the machine without any colinearity knob applied. Scan the Colinearity Knob Trim the colinearity knob , about one or two units at a time depending on the range of values you want to cover. For each setting, do some kicks and measure the \\(|C^{-}|\\) and the optics. Determine the Correction Plot the evolution of the \\(|C^{-}|\\) against the setting of the colinearity knob , and pick the setting that minimizes it. For best accuracy, one should substract the reference measurements (rematched optics without colinearity knob applied) for each measurement in the scans, eventually point by point. The curves for each beam might not be minimized exactly around the same point, and a compromise may be needed. Eventually do a fit of the data to get a better estimate of the correction. Optional: Perform a Luminosity Scan of the Colinearity Knob In commissioning and if conditions allow, one can validate and fine tune the correction with a luminosity scan. This has to be performed without a rigid waist shift : simply scan the colinearity knob around the previously determined correction setting, and measure the instantaneous luminosity. Optional: Do Global Corrections After Trimming One might want to do another round of global corrections, mainly coupling, after applying the determined colinearity knob setting.

Measure optics at smallest beta* for a long time, looking for an effect as in SKEKB where Final Focus quadrupole strength drifted by 0.01%. https://kds.kek.jp/event/39396/ Try Closed Orbit Distortion optics measurement as in SuperKEKB with 3-6 orbit correctors per plane and orbit fitting. Coupling Related \u00b6 Tilting triplets to correct local coupling to operate without MQSX. Switching off MCS and main sextupoles in one arc to evaluate possible (systematic) vertical or horizontal misalignment of dipoles by measuring coupling and beta-beating during the b3 decay. In a previous MD there was a quadratic coupling increase due to the orbit bump in the arc (maybe the one without MS, tbc). Crazy MD for this, could be shifting the edge of some dipoles up to see change in coupling. Tilting a triplet quadrupole to check validity of the tilt measurement (with and/or without beam). BPM related \u00b6 Measure bad BPMs with low and high intensities to detect possible issues with the comparator (transistor). Also swap connections between good and bad BPM to identified. Have one BPM unplugged to detect its noise until next technical stop. Momentum compaction factor from Qs versus Voltage. Snap-back with forced 3D oscillations (optics, chroma,...). Maybe not OMC: 24h pilot at top energy to use damped beam for BSRT resolution measurement. 0.5 um bunch from new injector chain?? Good for optics measurements, BSRT calibration etc. K-mod related \u00b6 K-Modulation with Xing angle and OFB off for Leon's Xing angle reconstruction. Arc K-modulation. K-modulation in IR4 during the energy ramp. Reduce to one the DCCTs per circuit with pilot in the machine and ATS optics to see the impact of 2 DCCTs. Michele Martino also proposes increasing in 1ppm the noise of the DCCTs in one or all dipole PCs to see impact on tune jitter. Non-Linear Optics Related \u00b6 Commissioning?: Measure amplitude detuning coming from CMS solenoid by having the on and off measurements. IR non-linear corrector offsets measurement. Emittance growth from octupoles and chroma. Amplitude detuning measurement versus crossing angle with b6 corrector on, for 5 crossing angles to evaluate performance of the technique for b6 correction. Amplitude dependent optics: Dedicated settings at injection as PoP (Thomas & Barbara), alternative techniques in parallel (K-modulation with decohered beams and amplitude dependent segment-by-segment). IR2 non-linear correction -> Dedicated squeeze for IR2 to allow for good triplet characterization to shed light on b4. Amplitude detuning in ballistic optics. ADT for single kicks. b5 RDTs. Measurement and correction of a3 RDTs at injection for lifetime optimization (correcting with MSSX and MSS). Reduce RF voltage to decrease synchrotron tune to limit the emittance blow-up during excitation with driven and natural tunes close to each other.","title":"Future MD Ideas"},{"location":"omc_team/ideas/#future-md-ideas","text":"","title":"Future MD Ideas"},{"location":"omc_team/ideas/#run-3-mds-ideas","text":"","title":"Run 3 MDs Ideas"},{"location":"omc_team/ideas/#linear-optics-related","text":"3 New ballistic optics flavors: Ballistic with beta* de-squeeze at top energy to reach above 1Km beta in dipoles, to study quadrupolar errors in dipoles.

Not only does it prevent version conflicts and ever-growing installations, it also allows separating production and test scenarios. Python Virtual Environments Don't know what a virtual environment is or what purpose it serves? Here is a good (but lengthy) primer on virtual environments by RealPython. Virtual Environments at CERN with Acc-Py \u00b6 The BE/CO Acc-Py distribution at CERN (at /acc/local/share/python/acc-py/base/pro ) allows one to create Python virtual environments immediately configured for internal CERN index and apps. Acc-Py is the official way to manage one's Python environments at CERN for the foreseeable future. However, because of how Python virtual environments work, the python executable in such a virtual environment is a symlink to the Acc-Py distribution's Python executable. This means any machine wanting to use this executable needs to also have read access to the location of the Acc-Py distribution in /acc/ , which means having access to the Technical Network. For this reason, one might want to install a standalone Acc-Py distribution somewhere else, for instance on afs . OMC Production Python The OMC team has a stable Python 3 production environment on afs . See this page to find out about it. The following section goes over installing a standalone Acc-Py distribution. If you already have one at the ready or plan to use the BE/CO Acc-Py , then skip ahead. Installing a Standalone Acc-Py \u00b6 The Acc-Py wiki has a section linking to installers one can download. From there download the appropriate file. The default distribution is recommended but installation is identical for other distributions (devel, rc). As of writing this walk-through, this corresponds to the acc-py-2020.11-installer.sh file. The installer itself is an executable to be called from the command line. Once the file is downloaded, run it at the command line (you might need to chmod u+x the file): bash acc-py-2020.11-installer.sh The installation script will prompt you to enter the location in which to install the distribution. This does not have to be an existing directory, it can be created at install. Choosing the Installation Location At post-install, the script will try to create a folder apps where it will install built applications, including the acc-py command line tool. This apps folder is created two directories up from the given installation location, which is a place you might not necessarily have access to. Should this be the case, the installation will error. To make sure you do not run into permission issues, it is advised to feed a nested location to the installer. For instance, instead of providing dist_location to the installer provide dist_location/base/2020.11 . This way the apps folder will be located at dist_location/apps to which you are guaranteed to have rights. When prompted by the script, enter the desired installation location (here dist_location/base/2020.11 ) and hit enter, then wait for the installation script to finish. If you have installed anaconda or miniconda previously, the process and its output will feel familiar. You are now done with the installation step. Creating Virtual Environments with Acc-Py \u00b6 To make the command line tools available in the current shell, source the setup.sh script in the installed Acc-Py distribution: source dist_location/base/2020.11/setup.sh You should see a confirmation message output that reads: => Acc-Py base 2020.11 is now active within this shell. You now have access to the acc-py command line tool, which you can verify by running acc-py -h and checking that you get the help command output. The command to create a virtual environment is based on the built-in venv module and should feel familiar if you know venv . To create a virtual environment, run: acc-py venv /path/to/environment/ This will create a virtual environment at /path/to/environment/ . To activate this environment, run: source /path/to/environment/bin/activate You can confirm you are running the appropriate Python with which python , which should point to /path/to/environment/bin/python . You can then install packages in this environment with: python -m pip install <package-name> Using python -m pip instead of simply pip guarantees that the right executable is called. Thanks to Acc-Py , everything is already set up to look into the CERN index, which is where many CERN apps and packages have to be installed from. Different ways to use pip for package installations are nicely explained in the official documentation . Accessing the CERN Index Installing from the CERN index requires the executing machine to have access to the CERN GPN (General Public Network), or to be tunnelled into the GPN . Using Your Virtual Environment \u00b6 When your virtual environment has all the packages you wish, anyone with access to the distribution's python executable (because all environments will symlink to there) can use it.

Acc-Py is the official way to manage one's Python environments at CERN for the foreseeable future. However, because of how Python virtual environments work, the python executable in such a virtual environment is a symlink to the Acc-Py distribution's Python executable. This means any machine wanting to use this executable needs to also have read access to the location of the Acc-Py distribution in /acc/ , which means having access to the Technical Network. For this reason, one might want to install a standalone Acc-Py distribution somewhere else, for instance on afs . OMC Production Python The OMC team has a stable Python 3 production environment on afs . See this page to find out about it. The following section goes over installing a standalone Acc-Py distribution.

From there download the appropriate file. The default distribution is recommended but installation is identical for other distributions (devel, rc). As of writing this walk-through, this corresponds to the acc-py-2020.11-installer.sh file. The installer itself is an executable to be called from the command line. Once the file is downloaded, run it at the command line (you might need to chmod u+x the file): bash acc-py-2020.11-installer.sh The installation script will prompt you to enter the location in which to install the distribution. This does not have to be an existing directory, it can be created at install. Choosing the Installation Location At post-install, the script will try to create a folder apps where it will install built applications, including the acc-py command line tool. This apps folder is created two directories up from the given installation location, which is a place you might not necessarily have access to. Should this be the case, the installation will error. To make sure you do not run into permission issues, it is advised to feed a nested location to the installer. For instance, instead of providing dist_location to the installer provide dist_location/base/2020.11 . This way the apps folder will be located at dist_location/apps to which you are guaranteed to have rights. When prompted by the script, enter the desired installation location (here dist_location/base/2020.11 ) and hit enter, then wait for the installation script to finish.

You now have access to the acc-py command line tool, which you can verify by running acc-py -h and checking that you get the help command output. The command to create a virtual environment is based on the built-in venv module and should feel familiar if you know venv . To create a virtual environment, run: acc-py venv /path/to/environment/ This will create a virtual environment at /path/to/environment/ . To activate this environment, run: source /path/to/environment/bin/activate You can confirm you are running the appropriate Python with which python , which should point to /path/to/environment/bin/python . You can then install packages in this environment with: python -m pip install <package-name> Using python -m pip instead of simply pip guarantees that the right executable is called. Thanks to Acc-Py , everything is already set up to look into the CERN index, which is where many CERN apps and packages have to be installed from. Different ways to use pip for package installations are nicely explained in the official documentation .

To follow along, the reader needs to have installed the omc3 package and to have measurement or simulation data to use the codes on. In case the reader does not have appropriate data to follow along with, a script is provided below to create some. The Analysis Workflow \u00b6 A typical workflow with omc3 consists in performing analysis of measurement or simulation files, and eventually calculating corrections to apply. While omc3 provides python modules to handle the different aspects of these tasks, it also provides entrypoint scripts to be called from the commandline. The first step in the workflow consists in a harmonic frequency analysis performed with the harpy module, while the second one is an optics analysis performed with the measure_optics module. The table below shows a general analysis workflow from BPM turn-by-turn measurements or simulation file to results, as well as the corresponding files at each step: Workflow & Files Turn-by-Turn BPM Data Frequency Spectra Various Lattice Optics Parameters SDDS files: *.sdds TFS files: *.lin[xy] TFS files: *.tfs In this page, we will go through the essential steps in preparing and performing an analysis, by going from start to finish with a simple example. In this walk-through, we will cover the use of the different entrypoints available to perform necessary steps. Example For our walk-through example, we will start from data obtained in MAD-X with the TRACK command for the 1023 turns in the LHC machine, with a scenario adapted from the 2018 configuration. Changes from the nominal scenario in your simulation could be including errors tables, orbit bumps, speculative magnet errors, additional elements etc. It is also easy for the reader to follow along if starting from measurements files. Generating the Example Data Here is the MAD-X script that will generate the example data used in this walk-through. It sets up a simple LHC configuration using files from afs , performs tracking and outputs a file named trackone . The script can be copy-pasted with a click in the top right of its box.

run , turns = 1023 ; endtrack ; Preparing Data for Analysis \u00b6 Analysis in omc3 is mostly done from measurement data, but can also be done on simulated tracking data. While omc3 codes can read data from many machine formats, we will for demonstration purposes first convert our data to the LHC's SDDS binary format. For this omc3 provides the tbt_converter entrypoint. A typical use consists in specifying the location of your turn-by-turn measurement files, the data type of said files and the location in which to write the converted SDDS data. The formats supported by the converter are: Machine formats: lhc , iota and esrf , or any machine using one of these. Simulation formats: the trackone and ptc formats from tracking data from MAD-X or PTC . The trackone and ptc formats What is referred to here as the trackone or ptc format is obtained by giving the DUMP and ONETABLE options to the TRACK or PTC_TRACK commands, respectively, in MAD-X . This way, all tracking data is written to a single file on disk, which you can feed to the tbt_converter . Remembering which tracking module was used is important as PTC_TRACK does not write in the same format as MAD-X 's TRACK . For our example, let us say that when setting up tracking we have asked MAD-X to output the data into a file called trackone (this is actually the default name). Using the converter to make a compatible SDDS file then goes as: python -m omc3.tbt_converter \\ --files trackone \\ --tbt_datatype trackone \\ --drop_elements LHCB1MSIA.EXIT.B1_P_ \\ --outputdir . Info When tracking in MAD-X , by default the start of machine will be included in the list of observation points. As we do not want this arbitrary point, we indicate to the tbt_converter we intend to drop it with the --drop_elements flag. More than one element can be given to this flag. The converter will create new files with the .sdds suffix appended to the original filename. In our case, a trackone.sdds file will be created. Other Uses The tbt_converter provides additional functionality such as adding noise to the provided data or averaging across particles. To use these options, refer to the converter's API documentation . Creating a Model \u00b6 In order to perform the optics analysis, one needs a model of the given machine to compare to. For this, omc3 provides the model_creator entrypoint, which allows you to run a model simulation of the desired machine and output the needed files. Supported Machines The out-of-the-box supported machines for model creation are lhc , ps and psbooster , machines we work on. While the skekb , JPARC , petra and iota have accelerator classes, no model creator has been implemented for them yet. It is possible to extend this list for your machine by defining an appropriate Accelerator class as well as a model creator. See this guide for implementation steps. In our example, we would like to compare our data to the nominal model of the 2018 LHC. Using the script to create a nominal model of the 2018 LHCB1, with the machine configuration and opticsfile used in our example, goes as: python -m omc3.model_creator \\ --accel lhc \\ --type nominal \\ --year 2018 \\ --beam 1 \\ --energy 6 .5 \\ --nat_tunes 62 .31 60 .32 \\ --modifiers /afs/cern.ch/eng/lhc/optics/runII/2018/PROTON/opticsfile.22 \\ --outputdir lhc_model Some of these options belong to the model_creator itself, while others depend explicitely on the chosen machine, here the LHC. Refer to the model creator's API documentation for the list of options. The model creation runs a MAD-X scenario and outputs the relevant twiss results to the desired directory. Running ls lhc_model/ yields: b2_errors.tfs error_deffs.txt macros twiss_elements.dat b2_settings.madx job.create_model.madx twiss.dat What is a Model? As one can see, a \"model\" is essentially one or more TFS files with optics functions at BPMs ( twiss.dat ) and elements ( twiss_elements.dat ), other files being here for the user to understand or reproduce the result. Had we created a driven model, then an additional twiss_ac.dat or twiss_adt.dat file would have been created, with optics functions at BPMs while driving the beam. One can create their own models without the model_creator should they want to, as it only acts as a convenience wrapper. A driven model is the same as above, with also a TWISS taking into account the exciting effect of an AC dipole or ADT onto the optics. Creating this is easiest done with the model_creator , but can also be done individually with the a script installing the appropriate element into your sequence. Frequency Analysis \u00b6 Once measurement or simulation is in the appropriate format, the first step as seen in the table above consists in a harmonic analysis of the data. To do so, omc3 provides the hole_in_one entrypoint, which will perform frequency analysis of the data when provided with the --harpy flag. The script provides options involved in both data cleaning and parameter tweaking for the harmonic analysis, which is useful when you have relevant information about your measurements. To use these, refer to the Harpy Kwargs section of the hole_in_one API documentation . In our example we will leave most of these to their default values to keep the analysis simple, but ask from harpy to output all computed results. We will input lhc for the --tbt_datatype flag, but if you skipped the use of the tbt_converter you should input the type of your machine there. Running the frequency analysis then goes as: python -m omc3.hole_in_one --harpy \\ --files trackone.sdds \\ --tbt_datatype lhc \\ --turns 0 1023 \\ --autotunes transverse \\ --to_write lin spectra full_spectra bpm_summary \\ --outputdir harpy_output Memory Requirements During frequency analysis, harpy makes use of zero padding (with by default \\(2^{20}\\) zeros) to improve the accuracy of results. In turn, the padded arrays become consequent and, coupled with a high number of observation points, processing will require a substantial amount of RAM - well into the few GBs range for our example. When running on limiting hardware, one can change the amount of zero padding with the --turn_bits flag for harpy . It is important however to remember that decreasing this number will reduce the accuracy of the results, since it increases the range between detected frequencies. Refer to the hole_in_one API documentation for details that could help in determining which number to use. In the output directory, harpy will create TFS files with the results of the analysis for both good BPMs and identified bad BPMs. The filenames are determined by appending the appropriate suffixes to the entry files. Bad BPMs If given bpm_summary for the --to_write flag (which is the case by default), harpy will output the .bad_bpms_[xy] files. BPMs are determined as bad or not depending on several options from the cleaning phase. While these are given sensible defaults, one might need to tweak them manually depending on their measurement. Additionally, known bad BPMs can be given with the --bad_bpms flag. In the output files, various properties are given in column form for each observation point. Running ls harpy_output/ yields the following result: trackone.sdds.ampsx trackone.sdds.freqsx trackone.sdds.ampsy trackone.sdds.freqsy trackone.sdds.bad_bpms_x trackone.sdds.linx trackone.sdds.bad_bpms_y trackone.sdds.liny Plotting the Spectra The omc3 package provides scripts and modules to quickly plot the spectra obtained from frequency analysis. To use these, refer to the Plot Spectrum API documentation. Column Nomenclature The *.amps[xy] , *.freqs[xy] and *.lin[xy] files in the harmonic analysis output are TFS files. The *.freqs[xy] files contain for each BPM in column format the frequencies of the resonance lines detected in the spectrum, for respectively the horizontal ( .freqsx ) and vertical ( .freqsy ) planes while the *.amps[xy] files contain the amplitudes of said resonance lines. This means in the column of a given BPM, the nth row in the .amps[xy] file corresponds to the amplitude of the resonance line located at the frequency given by the nth row in the column of the same name in the .freqs[xy] file. For illustration purposes, simplistic plotting of the horizontal spectrum (without the spectrum plotter mentioned above) from these files would go as: import tfs import matplotlib.pyplot as plt ampsx = tfs . read ( \"harpy_output/trackone.sdds.ampsx\" ) freqsx = tfs . read ( \"harpy_output/trackone.sdds.freqsx\" ) for bpm in ampsx . columns : if bpm in freqsx . columns : # safety check but no reason it wouldn't be there plt . plot ( freqsx [ bpm ], ampsx [ bpm ], \".-\" ) # plt.stem(freqsx[bpm], ampsx[bpm]) # would be more accurate but might stress your system plt . setp ( plt . gca (), xlabel = r \"$Q_x$\" , ylabel = \"Amplitude\" , title = \"Horizontal Spectrum\" , xlim = ( 0 , 0.5 )) The *.lin[xy] files contain various data (in columns) computed for each BPM (in rows) as some summary information. Some column names are explicit: BPM_RES contains the determined BPM resolution, CO the closed orbit value at said BPM and PK2PK is the peak-to-peak value of oscillations registered by the given BPM. TUNE[XY] , AMP[XY] and MU[XY] are the detected tune, the amplitude of the tune line and the phase of the tune line for said BPM, respectively. The other columns describe the phase ( PHASE ), amplitude ratio ( AMP ) and frequency ( FREQ ) of the line identified by the number in the column name, where underscores represent a minus sign. Therefore, in the .linx file FREQ01 , AMP01 and PHASE01 are respectively the frequency of the main vertical tune line in the horizontal spectrum, the ratio of this line's amplitude to that of the main horizontal line and the phase of this line. The equivalent columns in the .liny file are FREQ10 , AMP10 and PHASE10 . Generally speaking, the frequency and amplitude of higher order lines is calculated using \\(m \\cdot Q_x + n \\cdot Q_y\\) so FREQ1_3 corresponds to \\(m = 1\\) and \\(n = -3\\) which is a decapolar line ( \\(|m| + |n| = 4)\\) . For more information, this paper on normal forms is a good resource. Optics Analysis \u00b6 Once harmonic analysis has been performed, one can move on to the reconstruction of optics quantities from computed spectra and phases. To do so, omc3 provides the hole_in_one entrypoint, to be used this time with the --optics flag. In our example we will ask to use the three_bpm_method when reconstructing beta functions from phase advances, as the default n_bpm_method requires providing an error definition file which our simulation did not implement. Calling the entrypoint to perform optics analysis goes as: python -m omc3.hole_in_one --optics \\ --accel lhc \\ --year 2018 \\ --beam 1 \\ --energy 6 .5 \\ --files harpy_output/trackone.sdds \\ --model_dir lhc_model \\ --compensation none \\ --three_bpm_method \\ --outputdir measured_optics Input Files While harpy outputs various types of files with different suffixes, the optics analysis only looks for some of them. Thus, when providing the --files flag, no specific files should be provided, and instead the path to harpy outputs without a suffix should be given. In our example, this means entering harpy_output/trackone.sdds . Like other entrypoints, the optics analysis provides many options on methods to use and quantities to compute. To use these, refer to the Optics Kwargs section of the hole_in_one API documentation . In the output files, various properties are given in column form for each observation point. Running ls measured_optics/ yields the following result: beta_amplitude_x.tfs kick_x.tfs phase_y.tfs beta_amplitude_y.tfs kick_y.tfs special_phase_x.tfs beta_phase_x.tfs measure_optics.log special_phase_y.tfs beta_phase_y.tfs orbit_x.tfs total_phase_x.tfs interaction_point_x.tfs orbit_y.tfs total_phase_y.tfs interaction_point_y.tfs phase_x.tfs Hole in One The harmonic analysis and optics analysis don't necessarily have to be separated steps. It is possible to run the hole_in_one entrypoint with both --harpy and --optics flags, even though the command might become cumbersome. The associated flags and options do not change, although only one outputdir should be given. Our example done in one step would be: python -m omc3.hole_in_one --harpy --optics \\ --files trackone.sdds \\ --tbt_datatype lhc \\ --turns 0 1023 \\ --autotunes transverse \\ --to_write lin spectra full_spectra bpm_summary \\ --accel lhc \\ --year 2018 \\ --beam 1 \\ --model_dir lhc_model \\ --compensation none \\ --three_bpm_method \\ --coupling_method 1 \\ --outputdir measured_optics In this case, the output files from harpy are automatically handled and put into a subfolder named lin_files inside of the specified outputdir . The rest is done and output as seen above.","title":"Analysis"},{"location":"packages/omc3/analysis/#omc3-optics-analysis-workflow","text":"This page contains a walk-through of a typical but simple analysis workflow with the omc3 codes.

While omc3 provides python modules to handle the different aspects of these tasks, it also provides entrypoint scripts to be called from the commandline. The first step in the workflow consists in a harmonic frequency analysis performed with the harpy module, while the second one is an optics analysis performed with the measure_optics module. The table below shows a general analysis workflow from BPM turn-by-turn measurements or simulation file to results, as well as the corresponding files at each step: Workflow & Files Turn-by-Turn BPM Data Frequency Spectra Various Lattice Optics Parameters SDDS files: *.sdds TFS files: *.lin[xy] TFS files: *.tfs In this page, we will go through the essential steps in preparing and performing an analysis, by going from start to finish with a simple example. In this walk-through, we will cover the use of the different entrypoints available to perform necessary steps. Example For our walk-through example, we will start from data obtained in MAD-X with the TRACK command for the 1023 turns in the LHC machine, with a scenario adapted from the 2018 configuration. Changes from the nominal scenario in your simulation could be including errors tables, orbit bumps, speculative magnet errors, additional elements etc. It is also easy for the reader to follow along if starting from measurements files. Generating the Example Data Here is the MAD-X script that will generate the example data used in this walk-through. It sets up a simple LHC configuration using files from afs , performs tracking and outputs a file named trackone . The script can be copy-pasted with a click in the top right of its box. For anyone without access to afs , you can find these files in our MESS repository, or can simply use one of your own. option , warn , info ; option , echo = false , warn = false ; ! ----- Set up Lattice and Define the Optics ----- ! call , file = \"/afs/cern.ch/eng/lhc/optics/runII/2018/lhc_as-built.seq\" ; ! needs AFS access call , file = \"/afs/cern.ch/eng/lhc/optics/runII/2018/PROTON/opticsfile.22\" ; ! needs AFS access ! ----- Re-Cycle Sequence as in the Model ----- ! seqedit , sequence = lhcb1 ; flatten ; cycle , start = \"MSIA.EXIT.B1\" ; endedit ; ! ----- Create Beams ----- ! beam , sequence = lhcb1 , particle = proton , bv = 1 , energy = 6500 , npart = 1e10 , ex = 5.4115e-10 , ey = 5.4115e-10 ; beam , sequence = lhcb2 , particle = proton , bv =- 1 , energy = 6500 , npart = 1e10 , ex = 5.4115e-10 , ey = 5.4115e-10 ; use , sequence = lhcb1 ; ! ----- Introduce Some Coupling ----- !

While omc3 codes can read data from many machine formats, we will for demonstration purposes first convert our data to the LHC's SDDS binary format. For this omc3 provides the tbt_converter entrypoint. A typical use consists in specifying the location of your turn-by-turn measurement files, the data type of said files and the location in which to write the converted SDDS data. The formats supported by the converter are: Machine formats: lhc , iota and esrf , or any machine using one of these. Simulation formats: the trackone and ptc formats from tracking data from MAD-X or PTC . The trackone and ptc formats What is referred to here as the trackone or ptc format is obtained by giving the DUMP and ONETABLE options to the TRACK or PTC_TRACK commands, respectively, in MAD-X . This way, all tracking data is written to a single file on disk, which you can feed to the tbt_converter . Remembering which tracking module was used is important as PTC_TRACK does not write in the same format as MAD-X 's TRACK . For our example, let us say that when setting up tracking we have asked MAD-X to output the data into a file called trackone (this is actually the default name). Using the converter to make a compatible SDDS file then goes as: python -m omc3.tbt_converter \\ --files trackone \\ --tbt_datatype trackone \\ --drop_elements LHCB1MSIA.EXIT.B1_P_ \\ --outputdir . Info When tracking in MAD-X , by default the start of machine will be included in the list of observation points. As we do not want this arbitrary point, we indicate to the tbt_converter we intend to drop it with the --drop_elements flag. More than one element can be given to this flag. The converter will create new files with the .sdds suffix appended to the original filename. In our case, a trackone.sdds file will be created. Other Uses The tbt_converter provides additional functionality such as adding noise to the provided data or averaging across particles. To use these options, refer to the converter's API documentation .","title":"Preparing Data for Analysis"},{"location":"packages/omc3/analysis/#creating-a-model","text":"In order to perform the optics analysis, one needs a model of the given machine to compare to. For this, omc3 provides the model_creator entrypoint, which allows you to run a model simulation of the desired machine and output the needed files. Supported Machines The out-of-the-box supported machines for model creation are lhc , ps and psbooster , machines we work on. While the skekb , JPARC , petra and iota have accelerator classes, no model creator has been implemented for them yet. It is possible to extend this list for your machine by defining an appropriate Accelerator class as well as a model creator. See this guide for implementation steps. In our example, we would like to compare our data to the nominal model of the 2018 LHC. Using the script to create a nominal model of the 2018 LHCB1, with the machine configuration and opticsfile used in our example, goes as: python -m omc3.model_creator \\ --accel lhc \\ --type nominal \\ --year 2018 \\ --beam 1 \\ --energy 6 .5 \\ --nat_tunes 62 .31 60 .32 \\ --modifiers /afs/cern.ch/eng/lhc/optics/runII/2018/PROTON/opticsfile.22 \\ --outputdir lhc_model Some of these options belong to the model_creator itself, while others depend explicitely on the chosen machine, here the LHC. Refer to the model creator's API documentation for the list of options. The model creation runs a MAD-X scenario and outputs the relevant twiss results to the desired directory. Running ls lhc_model/ yields: b2_errors.tfs error_deffs.txt macros twiss_elements.dat b2_settings.madx job.create_model.madx twiss.dat What is a Model? As one can see, a \"model\" is essentially one or more TFS files with optics functions at BPMs ( twiss.dat ) and elements ( twiss_elements.dat ), other files being here for the user to understand or reproduce the result. Had we created a driven model, then an additional twiss_ac.dat or twiss_adt.dat file would have been created, with optics functions at BPMs while driving the beam. One can create their own models without the model_creator should they want to, as it only acts as a convenience wrapper. A driven model is the same as above, with also a TWISS taking into account the exciting effect of an AC dipole or ADT onto the optics. Creating this is easiest done with the model_creator , but can also be done individually with the a script installing the appropriate element into your sequence.","title":"Creating a Model"},{"location":"packages/omc3/analysis/#frequency-analysis","text":"Once measurement or simulation is in the appropriate format, the first step as seen in the table above consists in a harmonic analysis of the data. To do so, omc3 provides the hole_in_one entrypoint, which will perform frequency analysis of the data when provided with the --harpy flag. The script provides options involved in both data cleaning and parameter tweaking for the harmonic analysis, which is useful when you have relevant information about your measurements. To use these, refer to the Harpy Kwargs section of the hole_in_one API documentation . In our example we will leave most of these to their default values to keep the analysis simple, but ask from harpy to output all computed results. We will input lhc for the --tbt_datatype flag, but if you skipped the use of the tbt_converter you should input the type of your machine there. Running the frequency analysis then goes as: python -m omc3.hole_in_one --harpy \\ --files trackone.sdds \\ --tbt_datatype lhc \\ --turns 0 1023 \\ --autotunes transverse \\ --to_write lin spectra full_spectra bpm_summary \\ --outputdir harpy_output Memory Requirements During frequency analysis, harpy makes use of zero padding (with by default \\(2^{20}\\) zeros) to improve the accuracy of results. In turn, the padded arrays become consequent and, coupled with a high number of observation points, processing will require a substantial amount of RAM - well into the few GBs range for our example. When running on limiting hardware, one can change the amount of zero padding with the --turn_bits flag for harpy . It is important however to remember that decreasing this number will reduce the accuracy of the results, since it increases the range between detected frequencies. Refer to the hole_in_one API documentation for details that could help in determining which number to use. In the output directory, harpy will create TFS files with the results of the analysis for both good BPMs and identified bad BPMs. The filenames are determined by appending the appropriate suffixes to the entry files. Bad BPMs If given bpm_summary for the --to_write flag (which is the case by default), harpy will output the .bad_bpms_[xy] files. BPMs are determined as bad or not depending on several options from the cleaning phase. While these are given sensible defaults, one might need to tweak them manually depending on their measurement. Additionally, known bad BPMs can be given with the --bad_bpms flag. In the output files, various properties are given in column form for each observation point. Running ls harpy_output/ yields the following result: trackone.sdds.ampsx trackone.sdds.freqsx trackone.sdds.ampsy trackone.sdds.freqsy trackone.sdds.bad_bpms_x trackone.sdds.linx trackone.sdds.bad_bpms_y trackone.sdds.liny Plotting the Spectra The omc3 package provides scripts and modules to quickly plot the spectra obtained from frequency analysis. To use these, refer to the Plot Spectrum API documentation. Column Nomenclature The *.amps[xy] , *.freqs[xy] and *.lin[xy] files in the harmonic analysis output are TFS files. The *.freqs[xy] files contain for each BPM in column format the frequencies of the resonance lines detected in the spectrum, for respectively the horizontal ( .freqsx ) and vertical ( .freqsy ) planes while the *.amps[xy] files contain the amplitudes of said resonance lines. This means in the column of a given BPM, the nth row in the .amps[xy] file corresponds to the amplitude of the resonance line located at the frequency given by the nth row in the column of the same name in the .freqs[xy] file. For illustration purposes, simplistic plotting of the horizontal spectrum (without the spectrum plotter mentioned above) from these files would go as: import tfs import matplotlib.pyplot as plt ampsx = tfs . read ( \"harpy_output/trackone.sdds.ampsx\" ) freqsx = tfs . read ( \"harpy_output/trackone.sdds.freqsx\" ) for bpm in ampsx . columns : if bpm in freqsx . columns : # safety check but no reason it wouldn't be there plt . plot ( freqsx [ bpm ], ampsx [ bpm ], \".-\" ) # plt.stem(freqsx[bpm], ampsx[bpm]) # would be more accurate but might stress your system plt . setp ( plt . gca (), xlabel = r \"$Q_x$\" , ylabel = \"Amplitude\" , title = \"Horizontal Spectrum\" , xlim = ( 0 , 0.5 )) The *.lin[xy] files contain various data (in columns) computed for each BPM (in rows) as some summary information. Some column names are explicit: BPM_RES contains the determined BPM resolution, CO the closed orbit value at said BPM and PK2PK is the peak-to-peak value of oscillations registered by the given BPM. TUNE[XY] , AMP[XY] and MU[XY] are the detected tune, the amplitude of the tune line and the phase of the tune line for said BPM, respectively. The other columns describe the phase ( PHASE ), amplitude ratio ( AMP ) and frequency ( FREQ ) of the line identified by the number in the column name, where underscores represent a minus sign. Therefore, in the .linx file FREQ01 , AMP01 and PHASE01 are respectively the frequency of the main vertical tune line in the horizontal spectrum, the ratio of this line's amplitude to that of the main horizontal line and the phase of this line. The equivalent columns in the .liny file are FREQ10 , AMP10 and PHASE10 . Generally speaking, the frequency and amplitude of higher order lines is calculated using \\(m \\cdot Q_x + n \\cdot Q_y\\) so FREQ1_3 corresponds to \\(m = 1\\) and \\(n = -3\\) which is a decapolar line ( \\(|m| + |n| = 4)\\) . For more information, this paper on normal forms is a good resource.","title":"Frequency Analysis"},{"location":"packages/omc3/analysis/#optics-analysis","text":"Once harmonic analysis has been performed, one can move on to the reconstruction of optics quantities from computed spectra and phases. To do so, omc3 provides the hole_in_one entrypoint, to be used this time with the --optics flag. In our example we will ask to use the three_bpm_method when reconstructing beta functions from phase advances, as the default n_bpm_method requires providing an error definition file which our simulation did not implement. Calling the entrypoint to perform optics analysis goes as: python -m omc3.hole_in_one --optics \\ --accel lhc \\ --year 2018 \\ --beam 1 \\ --energy 6 .5 \\ --files harpy_output/trackone.sdds \\ --model_dir lhc_model \\ --compensation none \\ --three_bpm_method \\ --outputdir measured_optics Input Files While harpy outputs various types of files with different suffixes, the optics analysis only looks for some of them. Thus, when providing the --files flag, no specific files should be provided, and instead the path to harpy outputs without a suffix should be given. In our example, this means entering harpy_output/trackone.sdds . Like other entrypoints, the optics analysis provides many options on methods to use and quantities to compute. To use these, refer to the Optics Kwargs section of the hole_in_one API documentation . In the output files, various properties are given in column form for each observation point. Running ls measured_optics/ yields the following result: beta_amplitude_x.tfs kick_x.tfs phase_y.tfs beta_amplitude_y.tfs kick_y.tfs special_phase_x.tfs beta_phase_x.tfs measure_optics.log special_phase_y.tfs beta_phase_y.tfs orbit_x.tfs total_phase_x.tfs interaction_point_x.tfs orbit_y.tfs total_phase_y.tfs interaction_point_y.tfs phase_x.tfs Hole in One The harmonic analysis and optics analysis don't necessarily have to be separated steps. It is possible to run the hole_in_one entrypoint with both --harpy and --optics flags, even though the command might become cumbersome. The associated flags and options do not change, although only one outputdir should be given. Our example done in one step would be: python -m omc3.hole_in_one --harpy --optics \\ --files trackone.sdds \\ --tbt_datatype lhc \\ --turns 0 1023 \\ --autotunes transverse \\ --to_write lin spectra full_spectra bpm_summary \\ --accel lhc \\ --year 2018 \\ --beam 1 \\ --model_dir lhc_model \\ --compensation none \\ --three_bpm_method \\ --coupling_method 1 \\ --outputdir measured_optics In this case, the output files from harpy are automatically handled and put into a subfolder named lin_files inside of the specified outputdir . The rest is done and output as seen above.","title":"Optics Analysis"},{"location":"packages/omc3/getting_started/","text":"Getting Started with OMC3 \u00b6 Quick start \u00b6 The omc3 package is Python 3.7+ compatible, but not yet deployed to PyPI.

In theory, any kind of mask is possible, given the correct executable is provided and the Sixtrack output files created. Necessary Input Files To create the files needed for Sixtrack input in (HL-)LHC simulations, MAD-X masks need to contain: if ( NRJ < 500 0.0000 ) { VRF400 : = 8. ; } else { VRF400 : = 1 6. ; } ; LAGRF400 .

( interrupt ) check_input : check if sixdesk input is complete. submit_sixtrack : submit sixdesk jobs to HTCondor . ( interrupt ) check_sixtrack_output : check if all sixdesk jobs are completed. sixdb_load : create database and load jobs output. sixdb_cmd : calculate DA from database data. post_process : extract data from database, write into .tfs files and plot. final : announce every stage has completed. To keep track of the stages, they are written into a stages_completed.txt file in the autosix\\_output directory in the workspaces. Stages that are written in this file are assumed to be done and will be skipped. To rerun a stage, delete its entry and that of all following stages in the stages_completed.txt file and start your run anew. Execution Order The stages are ran independently of each job, meaning different jobs can be at different stages. For instance, if one job has all data for the six_db analysis already, but the others are still running on Sixdesk , the check_sixtrack_output stage will fail for these jobs but continue for the job that is ready. Because the stages after submit_mask and submit_sixtrack need only be ran after the jobs on HTCondor are completed, they will interrupt execution if previous stages have successfully finished. To have AutoSix continue its work, check your scheduler via condor_q and run your script again after everything is done. It will pick up where it left as written in the stages_completed.txt file. Custom sixdesk envs While most studies should be fine with the input options given, there is the possibility to manually adapt the sixdeskenv and sysenv files before workspace initialization by using the stop_workspace_init flag. This will not reset automatically and one will have to remove the switch again to continue.

As we will see later on, other methods methods require all parameter values to be written down while the pythonic way allows for an easier and clearer definition of the parameter space. The parametrizing of simulations and submission to HTCondor through Python is as simple as calling the main function of the submitter with the desired parameters. See below: import numpy as np from pylhc_submitter.job_submitter import main as htcondor_submit if __name__ == \"__main__\" : htcondor_submit ( executable = \"madx\" , # default pointing to the latest MAD-X on afs mask = \"my_madx.mask\" , # template to fill and execute MAD-X on replace_dict = dict ( # parameters to look for and replace in the template file BEAM = [ 1 , 2 ], TUNEX = np . linspace ( 62.3 , 62.32 , 11 ) . tolist (), TUNEY = np . linspace ( 60.31 , 60.33 , 11 ) . tolist (), ), jobid_mask = \"b %(BEAM)d .qx %(TUNEX)s .qy %(TUNEY)s \" , # naming of the submitted jobfiles working_directory = \"/afs/cern.ch/work/u/username/study.tune_sweep\" , # outputs jobflavour = \"workday\" , # htcondor flavour ) Starting Studies from a Config File \u00b6 The same can also be achieved by specifying the previously called parameters in a config.ini file. It is worth noting that with any submission, the job_submitter will create such a file. See below the equivalent config.ini of the above Python example: [DEFAULT] executable=\"madx\" mask=\"my_madx.mask\" working_directory=\"/afs/cern.ch/work/u/username/study.tune_sweep\" replace_dict={ \"BEAM\": [1, 2], \"TUNEX\": [62.3, 62.302, 62.304, 62.306, 62.308, 62.31, 62.312, 62.314, 62.316, 62.318, 62.32], \"TUNEY\": [60.31, 60.312, 60.314, 60.316, 60.318, 60.32, 60.322, 60.324, 60.326, 60.328, 60.33], } jobid_mask=\"b%(BEAM)d.qx%(TUNEX)s.qy%(TUNEY)s\" jobflavour=\"workday\" The jobs are then started by calling the submitter on this file from the command line: python -m pylhc_submitter.job_submitter --entry_cfg config.ini Starting Studies from the Command Line \u00b6 Users Beware While doing so is possible, using a simple command line call is discouraged. As we will see in the example below, this method is not as clear as the previous ones, and prone to errors. It is possible to skip the creation of a Python or a config.ini file completely when submitting, by providing parameters through the replace_dict flag at the command line. The above examples would be done through a (very lengthy) command line call as below: python -m pylhc_submitter.job_submitter --executable madx --mask my_madx.mask --working_directory /afs/cern.ch/work/u/username/study.tune_sweep --replace_dict \"{'BEAM': [1, 2], 'TUNEX': [62.3, 62.302, 62.304, 62.306, 62.308, 62.31, 62.312, 62.314, 62.316, 62.318, 62.32], 'TUNEY': [60.31, 60.312, 60.314, 60.316, 60.318, 60.32, 60.322, 60.324, 60.326, 60.328, 60.33]}\" --jobid_mask b% ( BEAM ) d.qx% ( TUNEX ) s.qy% ( TUNEY ) s --jobflavour workday Starting Studies with Mask Strings \u00b6 Instead of using a mask file, job_submitter can also use a string as input for the executable. This can prove useful if the executable has a number of variable input parameters, i.e. executable --param1 X --param2 Y . A simple mask string call using the config.ini input to the pylhc-submitter would look like this: [DEFAULT] executable=\"expr\" mask=\"%(SUMMAND1)s + %(SUMMAND2)s > Outputdata/result.txt\" working_directory=\"/afs/cern.ch/work/u/username/study.addition\" replace_dict={\"SUMMAND1\": [1, 2, 3, 4], \"SUMMAND2\": [6, 7, 8, 9]} run_local=True num_processes=4 Note that again, the user has to take care that the required results are saved in the correct job_output_dir . The mask string can be a more complicated multiline string, executing multiple commands. Example Multiline Config File [DEFAULT] executable=None mask=\"madx < Job%(SEED)s.madx\\n python -m analysis.main --method %(METHOD)s\" working_directory=\"/afs/cern.ch/work/u/username/study.multiline\" replace_dict={\"SEED\"= [1, 2, 3, 4], \"METHOD\"= ['fast', 'slow', 'new']} run_local=True num_processes=4 What Happens After Submitting \u00b6 When submitting, the job_submitter determines jobs to be submitted to HTCondor through the inner product of the replace_dict : in our example each possible combination of the 3 given parameters. The script will issue several logging statements to keep the user updated, but here is what happens behind the scenes. A folder structure is created in the given working directory , in which one will find: A Job.tfs file, a global summary dataframe in which each row corresponds to a set of parameters filled in for one submitted job: The first column, JobId , is either numbering of the jobs or - in our case - the filled in jobid_mask , The next columns are the given parameters, here: BEAM , TUNEX and TUNEY . They contain the value filled in the respective job-instance of said row, The JobDirectory , JobFile and ShellScript columns respectively contain the path to the job directory, the name of the filled mask file and the name of the script which are used to run the job. A queuehtc.sub file, the HTCondor submission file used, which tells HTCondor the paths to all the ShellScripts to run. Many sub-directories named according to the jobid_mask , one per job, each with: A ShellScript .sh , which contains commands to create the job_output_dir and the madx command to run the script, A JobFile which is the original mask , parameter values filled in. Dry Runs In case one runs the submitter with the dryrun flag, the execution stops here and prepared files are accessible, but nothing is sent to the HTCondor scheduler. One can use this option to perform a thorough check before using condor_submit on the created submission file queuehtc.sub . Number of Jobs As job_submitter creates a job for each combination in the inner product of the replace_dict parameters, the number of jobs can easily get high. In our example case, we are submitting beam * tunex * tuney = 2 * 11 * 11 = 242 jobs. It is worth noting that currently the maximum number of jobs to be submitted to HTCondor is set to 100k . After submitting our tune sweep studies, we can check the status of our jobs via the condor_q (unless running locally). The output should look something like this: condor_q : Shows the jobs in the condor queue. When all jobs are done running, the htcondor.<jobid>.err , htcondor.<jobid>.log and htcondor.<jobid>.out files for the respective job are transferred back to the appropriate directories. Finally, for each job the job_output_dir , here containing the .twiss.tfs file, will be transfered back as well, ready for post-processing. Checking for and Resubmitting Failed Jobs \u00b6 To see if and which Jobs have failed, the same command as above can be rerun using resume_jobs and dryrun flags (or use them as parameters set to True ). By default, Jobs are classified as successful if the specified job_output_dir is present. To resubmit the failed jobs to HTCondor , simply rerun the call and omit the dryrun flag or set its parameter to False . Refining the Resubmission To further refine the resubmission, the script can also check for the presence of files in the job_output_dir by using the check_files flag. In the case of our tune sweep example, this would look like check_files=[\"*.twiss.tfs\"] . Pitfalls and Hints \u00b6 The ssh Option When using the ssh option, the working directory needs to be accessible from both the local machine as well as the ssh server. In this case, ssh is only used for the final command submitting the jobs to HTCondor . Running Locally The run_local flag allows parallelizing jobs on your local machine through multiprocessing. This is only recommended for short jobs and for a small number of jobs, as the stress on your machine can be intense. The num_processes option allows to specify how many concurrent processes will run, by default 4.","title":"Job Submitter"},{"location":"packages/pylhcsubmitter/job_submitter/#pylhc-submitter","text":"See the API documentation for a detailed description of the code and the different parameters.

The above examples would be done through a (very lengthy) command line call as below: python -m pylhc_submitter.job_submitter --executable madx --mask my_madx.mask --working_directory /afs/cern.ch/work/u/username/study.tune_sweep --replace_dict \"{'BEAM': [1, 2], 'TUNEX': [62.3, 62.302, 62.304, 62.306, 62.308, 62.31, 62.312, 62.314, 62.316, 62.318, 62.32], 'TUNEY': [60.31, 60.312, 60.314, 60.316, 60.318, 60.32, 60.322, 60.324, 60.326, 60.328, 60.33]}\" --jobid_mask b% ( BEAM ) d.qx% ( TUNEX ) s.qy% ( TUNEY ) s --jobflavour workday","title":"Starting Studies from the Command Line"},{"location":"packages/pylhcsubmitter/job_submitter/#starting-studies-with-mask-strings","text":"Instead of using a mask file, job_submitter can also use a string as input for the executable. This can prove useful if the executable has a number of variable input parameters, i.e. executable --param1 X --param2 Y .

The script will issue several logging statements to keep the user updated, but here is what happens behind the scenes. A folder structure is created in the given working directory , in which one will find: A Job.tfs file, a global summary dataframe in which each row corresponds to a set of parameters filled in for one submitted job: The first column, JobId , is either numbering of the jobs or - in our case - the filled in jobid_mask , The next columns are the given parameters, here: BEAM , TUNEX and TUNEY . They contain the value filled in the respective job-instance of said row, The JobDirectory , JobFile and ShellScript columns respectively contain the path to the job directory, the name of the filled mask file and the name of the script which are used to run the job. A queuehtc.sub file, the HTCondor submission file used, which tells HTCondor the paths to all the ShellScripts to run. Many sub-directories named according to the jobid_mask , one per job, each with: A ShellScript .sh , which contains commands to create the job_output_dir and the madx command to run the script, A JobFile which is the original mask , parameter values filled in. Dry Runs In case one runs the submitter with the dryrun flag, the execution stops here and prepared files are accessible, but nothing is sent to the HTCondor scheduler. One can use this option to perform a thorough check before using condor_submit on the created submission file queuehtc.sub . Number of Jobs As job_submitter creates a job for each combination in the inner product of the replace_dict parameters, the number of jobs can easily get high. In our example case, we are submitting beam * tunex * tuney = 2 * 11 * 11 = 242 jobs. It is worth noting that currently the maximum number of jobs to be submitted to HTCondor is set to 100k . After submitting our tune sweep studies, we can check the status of our jobs via the condor_q (unless running locally). The output should look something like this: condor_q : Shows the jobs in the condor queue. When all jobs are done running, the htcondor.<jobid>.err , htcondor.<jobid>.log and htcondor.<jobid>.out files for the respective job are transferred back to the appropriate directories. Finally, for each job the job_output_dir , here containing the .twiss.tfs file, will be transfered back as well, ready for post-processing.","title":"What Happens After Submitting"},{"location":"packages/pylhcsubmitter/job_submitter/#checking-for-and-resubmitting-failed-jobs","text":"To see if and which Jobs have failed, the same command as above can be rerun using resume_jobs and dryrun flags (or use them as parameters set to True ). By default, Jobs are classified as successful if the specified job_output_dir is present. To resubmit the failed jobs to HTCondor , simply rerun the call and omit the dryrun flag or set its parameter to False . Refining the Resubmission To further refine the resubmission, the script can also check for the presence of files in the job_output_dir by using the check_files flag.

MAD-X Pitfalls \u00b6 MAD-X can sometimes be a bit tricky to work with. This section is intended to put together some common pitfalls encountered when creating a MAD-X script. MAD-X Errors As a reminder, MAD-X ignores all the code that does not work. It does not raise errors or crash like other languages, which can make it difficult to identify your mistakes. As a reminder: each instruction should end with a semicolon and MAD-X will consider everything a single command until the next ; is encountered. Tracking, Beam 2 and Beam 4 \u00b6 You might have noticed that an lhcb4.seq file is included in the acc-models-lhc repository. There is a specific caveat for the beam 2 sequence definition that one needs to be aware in order to do tracking. For practical reasons, the properties of all elements of the LHC are defined (in the lhc.seq ) as if they apply to a clockwise proton beam (beam 1). This allows a single definition for elements traversed by both beams. Their effects on a beam with identical particle charge but running in the opposite direction (beam 2) must then be reversed inside the program, which is achieved by creating a beam with a bv=-1 flag (section 7.4 ). However, in order to perform tracking for the lhcb2 sequence the exact elements definitions are necessary, as well as a bv flag of 1. This is done in the lhcb4.seq file. There is no such caveat for tracking with beam 1, which is why there is no \"beam 3\". Tracking Cheatsheet Beam 1 Beam 2 Tracking for Beam 1 does not have any caveat: Load the lhc.seq sequence file Create your beam for the lhcb1 sequence with the bv=1 flag Slice the lhcb1 sequence and track When tracking for beam 2, remember to: Load the lhcb4.seq sequence file Create your beam for the lhcb2 sequence with the bv=1 flag Slice the lhcb2 sequence and track What about model creation? If analysing the tracking data with either Beta-Beat.src or omc3 , one will need a model. The model has to have been made with the regular lhc.seq file, lhcb2 sequence, and a beam with bv=-1 . LSA Pitfalls \u00b6 Querying LSA is Slow \u00b6 You might run into an issue with the pylhc.machine_settings_info script where your query hangs for a (very) long time. This is due to the fact that pjlsa will look for the beamprocess at the given time and extract all trims for the required knobs through this beamprocess, even though only the last trim is displayed. Workarounds To speed up the script's runtime, try the following: Do not extract knobs if you are only after the summary information (this is now default behaviour) Only ask for the knobs you need (e.g. --knobs name1 name1 ), or just default ones (e.g. --knobs default ) if you're unsure Give a time range that is as small as possible using the --start-time and --time flags. This way a small trim history will be queried by pjlsa . For instance: python -m pylhc.machine_settings_info \\ --knobs name1 name2 \\ # with real names ;) --start-time \"2022-10-19 17:00:00.0\" \\ --time \"2022-10-19 17:30:00.0\" Be aware though that if no trim for the knobs are in the defined time range, no values will be returned at all.","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"resources/faqs/#frequently-asked-questions","text":"Info We are gradually including here different pieces of useful information, possibly from questions answered in meetings or on Mattermost, which don't really fit anywhere else as their whole page.","title":"Frequently Asked Questions"},{"location":"resources/faqs/#mad-x-pitfalls","text":"MAD-X can sometimes be a bit tricky to work with.
