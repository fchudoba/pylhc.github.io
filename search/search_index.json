The user can choose tasks to do for each IP . The AutoTrim then executes all the trimming tasks and analyzing tasks in the best order possible to optimize the process. The user can input parameters once to do the k-modulation and other analysis tasks on many IP 's. The results and current status of each process is displayed on the main panel. The AutoTrim provides something like a pipeline of many k-modulations and their analyzing tasks. First Time AutoTrim If you are in the CCC and have never used the AutoTrim before, follow these steps: Open the AutoTrimDialog by clicking on the AutoTim button located on the left side of the main panel. Add the IPs you want to trim or analyze with the buttons on the left side. Input the trim parameter or load an existing trim for each IP tab. Select the analyzing options you want to execute. Input the needed values for the trim and all the optional tasks. Once everything is set up, right press the Start button and select the directory where to save the results (It will save the results depending on the trim time and IP . See wiki for more information). The AutoTrim will now check if the orbit feedback is on and the tune feedback is off. Make sure to put them in the desired state. The ResultsView will open and the AutoTrim gets started. AutoTrim Panel \u00b6 The InputPanel \u00b6 This input panel provides all the options to set every parameter for k-modulation. On the left panel the user can choose which IP to trim or analyze. Depending on the parameters, the panel will show input panels for the specific IPs: each panel has a top bar with optional tasks that can be executed after the trim as well as an input field for the current energy. The energy value is gathered live from the LHC, but can be edited. Underneath is another tabbed pane for each task in the current process which needs some user input. The AutoTrim input panel. By pressing the start button, it will ask the user for the save directory and then starts the AutoTrim process. AutoTrim will then create a result folder for each IP , open the ResultsView on the main panel and start the pipeline of processes. The chosen save directory is the root directory. The AutoTrim will then create a subdirectory for each IP where the result files are stored. In principle, this will perform a full IP trim for all of the selected IPs and planes. For more details, see the full IP trim section. The ResultsView \u00b6 The ResultsView is the main panel of an AutoTrim process. It is built as a tabbed pane which holds the content of the processes for many IPs and displays information such as process status, results, etc. The status panel and the result panel are the main components for each process. The ResultsView. At the top is a thread queue bar which displays all the active, finished and scheduled threads. The thread queue of the results view. Tip By double-clicking on the IP label of the tabbed pane its possible to extract the IP panel in another frame. It will snap back to the tabbed pane if it gets closed by the user. The Status Panel \u00b6 The status panel shows information about the current process, with the currently running task is displayed at the top. The user can click through the list of tasks to see start/end time, input parameters, log entries, and the current status. There is also a panel for the input parameter of thes current task. This has to be done in the actual task code since the view doesn't have a reference to the task. The last panel is the logger text area for each task. Per default, it will show the last logging entry with the corresponding time, but the user can expand the list by clicking on the drop-down button. The AutoTrim Status Panel.

Crashed Task crashed because an exception is fired or a critical error occurred. * Not used at the moment, might be useful later (non thread-safe functionality, etc.) Loading Existing Trims from Timber \u00b6 The AutoTrim provides two ways to add existing trim data to the process queue: Adding the selected Timber entry directly to an existing IP tab in the AutoTrim panel. There, one can only select the trim entries depending on the IP of the tab. Selecting any trim you want with the Trim-Selection panel, which will then add the selected trims as tabs to the AutoTrim panel. Load a trim directly to an AutoTrim-Tab \u00b6 Start by creating your IP tab by clicking on the button on the left side: tick the Load existing trim checkbox and it will open the trim selection panel. AutoTrim: load existing trim. Expand the date picker and choose the day when the trim was executed. Left click on the trim you want to load and press the Select trim button. AutoTrim: load existing trim, date picker. The loaded trim date is then displayed on the trim panel and all the other input fields for the Full IP Trim are disabled, as input is not needed. To discard the loaded trim and proceed with the Full IP Trim instead, untick the Load existing trim checkbox. The Trim-Selection Panel \u00b6 The Trim-Selection panel will add the selected trim data as tabs to the AutoTrim panel. It also provides some basic options to apply to every tab, such as setting analyzing the orbit to default. This might be the best option if you want to reanalyze many trims with the same model. Open this panel by pressing the Load Trims button located on the bottom center of the AutoTrim panel. Filter the Timber entries by IP and date, then select the trim entries in the Search Results panel and press the green Add selected trim button. The trims are now selected and displayed in the Selected Trims panel. By clicking on confirm the tabs will be added to the AutoTrim panel. You can now set some basic options for the selected trims in the Options pane. These values are automatically set as preset values for the loaded trim tabs. The AutoTrim Trim Selection Wizard. Simulation Mode \u00b6 The kmod application provides two different modes to execute all its functionality: The Measurement mode , which is the standard mode and should be used in the control center to gather real data from the LHC. The Simulation mode , which only simulates these live measurements. If you start a normal trim task in Simulation mode the AutoTrim will load the last trim data from timber. This data is then displayed like a normal trim during a live measurement. The energy value is not automatically loaded from Timber, and uses a preset value of 6500.0 GeV. The AutoTrim won't check if the Orbit and Tune feedback is on or off. Analyzing a Trim \u00b6 Input Tab \u00b6 This input tab is separated into two sides, one for each existing beam in the LHC. One side holds the input fields for all needed parameters in order to run the beta star analysis script. It is also possible to provide only one estimated beta star value as input by ticking the Use round optics option. This checkbox will disable the input for the beta star in the vertical plane and uses the horizontal input for both. Parameters: B* X [m] : Estimated horizontal beta-star (X) of measurements as a double. B* Y [m] : Estimated vertical beta-star (Y) of measurements as a double.

For details, see the more extensive Wikipedia article about propagation of uncertainty or your favourite statistics textbook.","title":"Basic Error Propagation"},{"location":"omc_team/physics/#basics-of-accelerator-physics","text":"","title":"Basics of Accelerator Physics"},{"location":"omc_team/physics/#lhc-ir-linear-optics","text":"","title":"LHC IR Linear Optics"},{"location":"omc_team/physics/#lhc-ir-nonlinear-optics","text":"","title":"LHC IR NonLinear Optics"},{"location":"omc_team/publications/","text":"OMC Publications \u00b6 This page compiles various published papers, reports, and MD notes from OMC team members.

If you wish to contribute a solution, you can submit a Pull Request with a fix. However, before doing so, please read the submission guidelines bellow. Missing a feature? \u00b6 You can request a new feature by opening an issue on GitHub. If you would like to implement a new feature, please submit an issue with a proposal first, to be sure that it is necessary and appropriate to the package, and to discuss implementation details. This will also allow us to better coordinate our efforts, prevent duplication of work, and help you craft the change so that it is successfully accepted into the project. Our Availability Please note we are busy people and developing these packages is not our primary priority at work. We may take some time to reply. Submission guidelines \u00b6 Submitting an issue \u00b6 Before you submit an issue, please search the issue tracker, maybe an issue for your problem already exists and the discussion might inform you of fixes or workarounds readily available. If you are submitting a bug report, please also provide a minimal scenario to reproduce it. Submitting a Pull Request (PR) \u00b6 First, search GitHub for an open or closed PR that relates to your submission. If you do not find a related issue or PR, or if your PR is the implementation for an issue you open, go ahead. Development : Clone the project, set up your branch and development environment, make your changes, and add descriptive messages to your commits. Please reference the issue number in your commit header messages so that your commits appear on the issue tracker. Build : Before submitting changes, please make sure tests pass and that the package properly installs. Most projects come with a Makefile to help with this, and you can get an overview of the available targets with make help . Pull Request : After having worked on your changes and pushed them to Github, open a Pull Request to the master branch. Review and approval by at least one of our team members is required before accepting changes. If new changes are suggested, make the required updates and push the changes again. Please do not require a review until all the quality checks pass. Quality checks \u00b6 Unit and accuracy tests are run automatically through CI Github Actions . A README.md file in the .github/workflows directory details our CI jobs. Additional checks for code-complexity, design-rules, test-coverage and duplication are made through CodeClimate . Pull requests implementing functionality or fixes are merged into the master branch after passing CI, and a reviewer's approval. After your PR is accepted by a team member, please select squash and merge to merge into master. Afterwards, you can safely delete your branch and close the issue. Python Guidelines \u00b6 We strive to use a common codestyle for our software. Please follow these guidelines to keep code cohesion up, and git diffs down. In case you want to contribute to a package's development, you should install it in editable mode: git clone https://github.com/pylhc/package_name pip install --editable package_name Installing Extras You can install extra dependencies (as defined in setup.py ) suited to your use case with the following commands: pip install --editable package_name [ test ] pip install --editable package_name [ test,doc ] pip install --editable package_name [ all ] For development purposes, we recommend using the all extra to be fully set up. Naming Conventions \u00b6 Overall, please abide by PEP8 : Module, functions, methods, attributes and local variable names: use snake_case . Example: segment_by_segment.py , get_phase.py . Class names: use PascalCase . Example: FileWriter , FixedTfs . Module constants: Uppercase words divided by underscores. Example: INDEX_ID , DEFAULT_COLUMN_WIDTH . Private methods, functions and variables: see above, but precede the name by an underscore. Example: _validate_index_type , _get_header_line . Code Structure \u00b6 Make the code as readable as possible, both for collaborators and future you. Use descriptive variable names. Use descriptive function names. Type hint your code. Respect the max line length of 100 characters as much as possible. Divide code blocks into simple functions. Strive to write pure functions . Avoid code duplication. Respect the Zen of Python . We use PyCharm as IDE in the team.

Python Virtual Environments Don't know what a virtual environment is or the difference between these many tools? Here is a good (but lengthy) primer on virtual environments by RealPython. Python environments are created using the built-in venv module, with the old pyvenv being deprecated since Python 3.6 and as such not recommended. The following description is a summary of the steps presented here and here , targetting Unix users. What About Anaconda? Note that the Anaconda Python distribution provides the conda tool as a package manager, which also allows the creation of Python virtual environments. However, due to the simplicity of the venv module, only this module will be described in the following. Virtual Environments with pyvenv \u00b6 To create a virtual environment in the folder testpython , run the command python -m venv ./testpython This creates a python environment in the testpython folder, linking to the original Python installation. As such, all packages of the original installation are available. However, using a clean and up-to-date Python 3 installation is recommended.

The general Python distribution acc-py , maintained by BE/CO, is detailed in this wiki . To activate the created python installation, run source ./testpython/env/activate Now, the alias python should link to the installation in the testpython folder instead of the standard installation. This can be checked on Unix systems with the command which python . Note that the following command also provides access to the new installation and can be used to run scripts: ./testpython/bin/python To leave the Python environment, run: deactivate After the activation of the environment, packages can be installed with pip . The packages installed this way will be put in the testpython folder structure and will thus not affect the main system installation.

To follow along, the reader needs to have installed the omc3 package and to have measurement or simulation data to use the codes on. In case the reader does not have appropriate data to follow along with, a script is provided below to create some. The Analysis Workflow \u00b6 A typical workflow with omc3 consists in performing analysis of measurement or simulation files, and eventually calculating corrections to apply. While omc3 provides python modules to handle the different aspects of these tasks, it also provides entrypoint scripts to be called from the commandline. The first step in the workflow consists in a harmonic frequency analysis performed with the harpy module, while the second one is an optics analysis performed with the measure_optics module. The table below shows a general analysis workflow from BPM turn-by-turn measurements or simulation file to results, as well as the corresponding files at each step: Workflow & Files Turn-by-Turn BPM Data Frequency Spectra Various Lattice Optics Parameters SDDS files: *.sdds TFS files: *.lin[xy] TFS files: *.tfs In this page, we will go through the essential steps in preparing and performing an analysis, by going from start to finish with a simple example. In this walk-through, we will cover the use of the different entrypoints available to perform necessary steps. For our walk-through example, we will start from data obtained in MAD-X with the TRACK command for the 1023 turns in the LHC machine, with a scenario adapted from the 2018 configuration. Changes from the nominal scenario in your simulation could be including errors tables, orbit bumps, speculative magnet errors, additional elements etc. It is also easy for the reader to follow along if starting from measurements files. Generating the Example Data Here is the MAD-X script that will generate the example data used in this walk-through. It sets up a simple LHC configuration using files from afs , performs tracking and outputs a file named trackone . The script can be copy-pasted with a click in the top right of its box. For anyone without access to afs , you can find these files in our MESS repository, or can simply use one of your own. option , warn , info ; option , echo = false , warn = false ; ! ----- Set up Lattice and Define the Optics ----- ! call , file = \"/afs/cern.ch/eng/lhc/optics/runII/2018/lhc_as-built.seq\" ; ! needs AFS access call , file = \"/afs/cern.ch/eng/lhc/optics/runII/2018/PROTON/opticsfile.22\" ; ! needs AFS access ! ----- Re-Cycle Sequence as in the Model ----- ! seqedit , sequence = lhcb1 ; flatten ; cycle , start = \"MSIA.EXIT.B1\" ; endedit ; ! ----- Create Beams ----- ! beam , sequence = lhcb1 , particle = proton , bv = 1 , energy = 6500 , npart = 1e10 , ex = 5.4115e-10 , ey = 5.4115e-10 ; beam , sequence = lhcb2 , particle = proton , bv =- 1 , energy = 6500 , npart = 1e10 , ex = 5.4115e-10 , ey = 5.4115e-10 ; use , sequence = lhcb1 ; ! ----- Introduce Some Coupling ----- !

While omc3 codes can read data from many machine formats, we will for demonstration purposes first convert our data to the LHC's SDDS binary format. For this omc3 provides the tbt_converter entrypoint. A typical use consists in specifying the location of your turn-by-turn measurement files, the data type of said files and the location in which to write the converted SDDS data. The formats supported by the converter are: Machine formats: lhc , iota and esrf , or any machine using one of these. Simulation formats: the trackone and ptc formats from tracking data from MAD-X or PTC . The trackone and ptc formats What is referred to here as the trackone or ptc format is obtained by giving the DUMP and ONETABLE options to the TRACK or PTC_TRACK commands, respectively, in MAD-X . This way, all tracking data is written to a single file on disk, which you can feed to the tbt_converter . Remembering which tracking module was used is important as PTC_TRACK does not write in the same format as MAD-X 's TRACK . For our example, let us say that when setting up tracking we have asked MAD-X to output the data into a file called trackone (this is actually the default name). Using the converter to make a compatible SDDS file then goes as: python -m omc3.tbt_converter \\ --files trackone \\ --tbt_datatype trackone \\ --drop_elements LHCB1MSIA.EXIT.B1_P_ \\ --outputdir . When tracking in MAD-X , by default the start of machine will be included in the list of observation points. As we do not want this arbitrary point, we indicate to the tbt_converter we intend to drop it with the --drop_elements flag. More than one element can be given to this flag. The converter will create new files with the .sdds suffix appended to the original filename. In our case, a trackone.sdds file will be created. Other Uses The tbt_converter provides additional functionality such as adding noise to the provided data or averaging across particles. To use these options, refer to the converter's API documentation . Creating a Model \u00b6 In order to perform the optics analysis, one needs a model of the given machine to compare to. For this, omc3 provides the model_creator entrypoint, which allows you to run a model simulation of the desired machine and output the needed files. Supported Machines The out-of-the-box supported machines for model creation are lhc , ps and psbooster , machines we work on. While the skekb , JPARC , petra and iota have accelerator classes, no model creator has been implemented for them yet. It is possible to extend this list for your machine by defining an appropriate Accelerator class as well as a model creator. See this guide for implementation steps. In our example, we would like to compare our data to the nominal model of the 2018 LHC. Using the script to create a nominal model of the 2018 LHCB1, with the machine configuration and opticsfile used in our example, goes as: python -m omc3.model_creator \\ --accel lhc \\ --type nominal \\ --year 2018 \\ --beam 1 \\ --energy 6 .5 \\ --nat_tunes 62 .31 60 .32 \\ --modifiers /afs/cern.ch/eng/lhc/optics/runII/2018/PROTON/opticsfile.22 \\ --outputdir lhc_model Specifying Paths At the moment, some issues may arise down the line when specifying input files with relative paths. To ensure a seamless workflow, it is recommended to use absolute paths. This will be dealt with in the next release. Some of these options belong to the model_creator itself, while others depend explicitely on the chosen machine, here the LHC. Refer to the model creator's API documentation for the list of options. The model creation runs a MAD-X scenario and outputs the relevant twiss results to the desired directory. Running ls lhc_model/ yields: b2_errors.tfs error_deffs.txt macros twiss_elements.dat b2_settings.madx job.create_model.madx twiss.dat What is a Model? As one can see, a \"model\" is essentially one or more TFS files with optics functions at BPMs ( twiss.dat ) and elements ( twiss_elements.dat ), other files being here for the user to understand or reproduce the result. Had we created a driven model, then an additional twiss_ac.dat or twiss_adt.dat file would have been created, with optics functions at BPMs while driving the beam. One can create their own models without the model_creator should they want to, as it only acts as a convenience wrapper. A driven model is the same as above, with also a TWISS taking into account the exciting effect of an AC dipole or ADT onto the optics. Creating this is easiest done with the model_creator , but can also be done individually with the a script installing the appropriate element into your sequence. Frequency Analysis \u00b6 Once measurement or simulation is in the appropriate format, the first step as seen in the table above consists in a harmonic analysis of the data. To do so, omc3 provides the hole_in_one entrypoint, which will perform frequency analysis of the data when provided with the --harpy flag. The script provides options involved in both data cleaning and parameter tweaking for the harmonic analysis, which is useful when you have relevant information about your measurements. To use these, refer to the Harpy Kwargs section of the hole_in_one API documentation . In our example we will leave most of these to their default values to keep the analysis simple, but ask from harpy to output all computed results. We will input lhc for the --tbt_datatype flag, but if you skipped the use of the tbt_converter you should input the type of your machine there. Running the frequency analysis then goes as: python -m omc3.hole_in_one --harpy \\ --files trackone.sdds \\ --tbt_datatype lhc \\ --turns 0 1023 \\ --autotunes transverse \\ --to_write lin spectra full_spectra bpm_summary \\ --outputdir harpy_output Memory Requirements During frequency analysis, harpy makes use of zero padding (with by default \\(2^{20}\\) zeros) to improve the accuracy of results. In turn, the padded arrays become consequent and, coupled with a high number of observation points, processing will require a substantial amount of RAM - well into the few GBs range for our example. When running on limiting hardware, one can change the amount of zero padding with the --turn_bits flag for harpy . It is important however to remember that decreasing this number will reduce the accuracy of the results, since it increases the range between detected frequencies. Refer to the hole_in_one API documentation for details that could help in determining which number to use. In the output directory, harpy will create TFS files with the results of the analysis for both good BPMs and identified bad BPMs. The filenames are determined by appending the appropriate suffixes to the entry files. Bad BPMs If given bpm_summary for the --to_write flag (which is the case by default), harpy will output the .bad_bpms_[xy] files. BPMs are determined as bad or not depending on several options from the cleaning phase. While these are given sensible defaults, one might need to tweak them manually depending on their measurement. Additionally, known bad BPMs can be given with the --bad_bpms flag. In the output files, various properties are given in column form for each observation point. Running ls harpy_output/ yields the following result: trackone.sdds.ampsx trackone.sdds.freqsx trackone.sdds.ampsy trackone.sdds.freqsy trackone.sdds.bad_bpms_x trackone.sdds.linx trackone.sdds.bad_bpms_y trackone.sdds.liny Plotting the Spectra The omc3 package provides scripts and modules to quickly plot the spectra obtained from frequency analysis. To use these, refer to the Plot Spectrum API documentation. Column Nomenclature TODO: add a reference with the meaning of each column in the important files (the .lin* ones) Optics Analysis \u00b6 Once harmonic analysis has been performed, one can move on to the reconstruction of optics quantities from computed spectra and phases. To do so, omc3 provides the hole_in_one entrypoint, to be used this time with the --optics flag. In our example we will ask to use the three_bpm_method when reconstructing beta functions from phase advances, as the default n_bpm_method requires providing an error definition file which our simulation did not implement. Calling the entrypoint to perform optics analysis goes as: python -m omc3.hole_in_one --optics \\ --accel lhc \\ --year 2018 \\ --beam 1 \\ --energy 6 .5 \\ --files harpy_output/trackone.sdds \\ --model_dir lhc_model \\ --compensation none \\ --three_bpm_method \\ --outputdir measured_optics Input Files While harpy outputs various types of files with different suffixes, the optics analysis only looks for some of them. Thus, when providing the --files flag, no specific files should be provided, and instead the path to harpy outputs without a suffix should be given. In our example, this means entering harpy_output/trackone.sdds . Like other entrypoints, the optics analysis provides many options on methods to use and quantities to compute. To use these, refer to the Optics Kwargs section of the hole_in_one API documentation . In the output files, various properties are given in column form for each observation point. Running ls measured_optics/ yields the following result: beta_amplitude_x.tfs kick_x.tfs phase_y.tfs beta_amplitude_y.tfs kick_y.tfs special_phase_x.tfs beta_phase_x.tfs measure_optics.log special_phase_y.tfs beta_phase_y.tfs orbit_x.tfs total_phase_x.tfs interaction_point_x.tfs orbit_y.tfs total_phase_y.tfs interaction_point_y.tfs phase_x.tfs Hole in One The harmonic analysis and optics analysis don't necessarily have to be separated steps. It is possible to run the hole_in_one entrypoint with both --harpy and --optics flags, even though the command might become cumbersome. The associated flags and options do not change, although only one outputdir should be given. Our example done in one step would be: python -m omc3.hole_in_one --harpy --optics \\ --files trackone.sdds \\ --tbt_datatype lhc \\ --turns 0 1023 \\ --autotunes transverse \\ --to_write lin spectra full_spectra bpm_summary \\ --accel lhc \\ --year 2018 \\ --beam 1 \\ --model_dir lhc_model \\ --compensation none \\ --three_bpm_method \\ --coupling_method 1 \\ --outputdir measured_optics In this case, the output files from harpy are automatically handled and put into a subfolder named lin_files inside of the specified outputdir . The rest is done and output as seen above.","title":"Workflow"},{"location":"packages/omc3/workflow/#omc3-software-workflow","text":"This page contains a walk-through of a typical but simple analysis workflow with the omc3 codes.

The table below shows a general analysis workflow from BPM turn-by-turn measurements or simulation file to results, as well as the corresponding files at each step: Workflow & Files Turn-by-Turn BPM Data Frequency Spectra Various Lattice Optics Parameters SDDS files: *.sdds TFS files: *.lin[xy] TFS files: *.tfs In this page, we will go through the essential steps in preparing and performing an analysis, by going from start to finish with a simple example. In this walk-through, we will cover the use of the different entrypoints available to perform necessary steps. For our walk-through example, we will start from data obtained in MAD-X with the TRACK command for the 1023 turns in the LHC machine, with a scenario adapted from the 2018 configuration. Changes from the nominal scenario in your simulation could be including errors tables, orbit bumps, speculative magnet errors, additional elements etc. It is also easy for the reader to follow along if starting from measurements files.

While omc3 codes can read data from many machine formats, we will for demonstration purposes first convert our data to the LHC's SDDS binary format. For this omc3 provides the tbt_converter entrypoint. A typical use consists in specifying the location of your turn-by-turn measurement files, the data type of said files and the location in which to write the converted SDDS data. The formats supported by the converter are: Machine formats: lhc , iota and esrf , or any machine using one of these. Simulation formats: the trackone and ptc formats from tracking data from MAD-X or PTC . The trackone and ptc formats What is referred to here as the trackone or ptc format is obtained by giving the DUMP and ONETABLE options to the TRACK or PTC_TRACK commands, respectively, in MAD-X . This way, all tracking data is written to a single file on disk, which you can feed to the tbt_converter . Remembering which tracking module was used is important as PTC_TRACK does not write in the same format as MAD-X 's TRACK . For our example, let us say that when setting up tracking we have asked MAD-X to output the data into a file called trackone (this is actually the default name). Using the converter to make a compatible SDDS file then goes as: python -m omc3.tbt_converter \\ --files trackone \\ --tbt_datatype trackone \\ --drop_elements LHCB1MSIA.EXIT.B1_P_ \\ --outputdir . When tracking in MAD-X , by default the start of machine will be included in the list of observation points. As we do not want this arbitrary point, we indicate to the tbt_converter we intend to drop it with the --drop_elements flag. More than one element can be given to this flag. The converter will create new files with the .sdds suffix appended to the original filename. In our case, a trackone.sdds file will be created. Other Uses The tbt_converter provides additional functionality such as adding noise to the provided data or averaging across particles. To use these options, refer to the converter's API documentation .","title":"Preparing Data for Analysis"},{"location":"packages/omc3/workflow/#creating-a-model","text":"In order to perform the optics analysis, one needs a model of the given machine to compare to. For this, omc3 provides the model_creator entrypoint, which allows you to run a model simulation of the desired machine and output the needed files. Supported Machines The out-of-the-box supported machines for model creation are lhc , ps and psbooster , machines we work on. While the skekb , JPARC , petra and iota have accelerator classes, no model creator has been implemented for them yet. It is possible to extend this list for your machine by defining an appropriate Accelerator class as well as a model creator. See this guide for implementation steps. In our example, we would like to compare our data to the nominal model of the 2018 LHC. Using the script to create a nominal model of the 2018 LHCB1, with the machine configuration and opticsfile used in our example, goes as: python -m omc3.model_creator \\ --accel lhc \\ --type nominal \\ --year 2018 \\ --beam 1 \\ --energy 6 .5 \\ --nat_tunes 62 .31 60 .32 \\ --modifiers /afs/cern.ch/eng/lhc/optics/runII/2018/PROTON/opticsfile.22 \\ --outputdir lhc_model Specifying Paths At the moment, some issues may arise down the line when specifying input files with relative paths. To ensure a seamless workflow, it is recommended to use absolute paths. This will be dealt with in the next release. Some of these options belong to the model_creator itself, while others depend explicitely on the chosen machine, here the LHC. Refer to the model creator's API documentation for the list of options. The model creation runs a MAD-X scenario and outputs the relevant twiss results to the desired directory. Running ls lhc_model/ yields: b2_errors.tfs error_deffs.txt macros twiss_elements.dat b2_settings.madx job.create_model.madx twiss.dat What is a Model? As one can see, a \"model\" is essentially one or more TFS files with optics functions at BPMs ( twiss.dat ) and elements ( twiss_elements.dat ), other files being here for the user to understand or reproduce the result. Had we created a driven model, then an additional twiss_ac.dat or twiss_adt.dat file would have been created, with optics functions at BPMs while driving the beam. One can create their own models without the model_creator should they want to, as it only acts as a convenience wrapper. A driven model is the same as above, with also a TWISS taking into account the exciting effect of an AC dipole or ADT onto the optics. Creating this is easiest done with the model_creator , but can also be done individually with the a script installing the appropriate element into your sequence.","title":"Creating a Model"},{"location":"packages/omc3/workflow/#frequency-analysis","text":"Once measurement or simulation is in the appropriate format, the first step as seen in the table above consists in a harmonic analysis of the data. To do so, omc3 provides the hole_in_one entrypoint, which will perform frequency analysis of the data when provided with the --harpy flag. The script provides options involved in both data cleaning and parameter tweaking for the harmonic analysis, which is useful when you have relevant information about your measurements. To use these, refer to the Harpy Kwargs section of the hole_in_one API documentation . In our example we will leave most of these to their default values to keep the analysis simple, but ask from harpy to output all computed results. We will input lhc for the --tbt_datatype flag, but if you skipped the use of the tbt_converter you should input the type of your machine there. Running the frequency analysis then goes as: python -m omc3.hole_in_one --harpy \\ --files trackone.sdds \\ --tbt_datatype lhc \\ --turns 0 1023 \\ --autotunes transverse \\ --to_write lin spectra full_spectra bpm_summary \\ --outputdir harpy_output Memory Requirements During frequency analysis, harpy makes use of zero padding (with by default \\(2^{20}\\) zeros) to improve the accuracy of results. In turn, the padded arrays become consequent and, coupled with a high number of observation points, processing will require a substantial amount of RAM - well into the few GBs range for our example. When running on limiting hardware, one can change the amount of zero padding with the --turn_bits flag for harpy . It is important however to remember that decreasing this number will reduce the accuracy of the results, since it increases the range between detected frequencies. Refer to the hole_in_one API documentation for details that could help in determining which number to use. In the output directory, harpy will create TFS files with the results of the analysis for both good BPMs and identified bad BPMs. The filenames are determined by appending the appropriate suffixes to the entry files. Bad BPMs If given bpm_summary for the --to_write flag (which is the case by default), harpy will output the .bad_bpms_[xy] files. BPMs are determined as bad or not depending on several options from the cleaning phase. While these are given sensible defaults, one might need to tweak them manually depending on their measurement. Additionally, known bad BPMs can be given with the --bad_bpms flag. In the output files, various properties are given in column form for each observation point. Running ls harpy_output/ yields the following result: trackone.sdds.ampsx trackone.sdds.freqsx trackone.sdds.ampsy trackone.sdds.freqsy trackone.sdds.bad_bpms_x trackone.sdds.linx trackone.sdds.bad_bpms_y trackone.sdds.liny Plotting the Spectra The omc3 package provides scripts and modules to quickly plot the spectra obtained from frequency analysis. To use these, refer to the Plot Spectrum API documentation. Column Nomenclature TODO: add a reference with the meaning of each column in the important files (the .lin* ones)","title":"Frequency Analysis"},{"location":"packages/omc3/workflow/#optics-analysis","text":"Once harmonic analysis has been performed, one can move on to the reconstruction of optics quantities from computed spectra and phases. To do so, omc3 provides the hole_in_one entrypoint, to be used this time with the --optics flag. In our example we will ask to use the three_bpm_method when reconstructing beta functions from phase advances, as the default n_bpm_method requires providing an error definition file which our simulation did not implement. Calling the entrypoint to perform optics analysis goes as: python -m omc3.hole_in_one --optics \\ --accel lhc \\ --year 2018 \\ --beam 1 \\ --energy 6 .5 \\ --files harpy_output/trackone.sdds \\ --model_dir lhc_model \\ --compensation none \\ --three_bpm_method \\ --outputdir measured_optics Input Files While harpy outputs various types of files with different suffixes, the optics analysis only looks for some of them. Thus, when providing the --files flag, no specific files should be provided, and instead the path to harpy outputs without a suffix should be given. In our example, this means entering harpy_output/trackone.sdds . Like other entrypoints, the optics analysis provides many options on methods to use and quantities to compute. To use these, refer to the Optics Kwargs section of the hole_in_one API documentation . In the output files, various properties are given in column form for each observation point. Running ls measured_optics/ yields the following result: beta_amplitude_x.tfs kick_x.tfs phase_y.tfs beta_amplitude_y.tfs kick_y.tfs special_phase_x.tfs beta_phase_x.tfs measure_optics.log special_phase_y.tfs beta_phase_y.tfs orbit_x.tfs total_phase_x.tfs interaction_point_x.tfs orbit_y.tfs total_phase_y.tfs interaction_point_y.tfs phase_x.tfs Hole in One The harmonic analysis and optics analysis don't necessarily have to be separated steps. It is possible to run the hole_in_one entrypoint with both --harpy and --optics flags, even though the command might become cumbersome. The associated flags and options do not change, although only one outputdir should be given. Our example done in one step would be: python -m omc3.hole_in_one --harpy --optics \\ --files trackone.sdds \\ --tbt_datatype lhc \\ --turns 0 1023 \\ --autotunes transverse \\ --to_write lin spectra full_spectra bpm_summary \\ --accel lhc \\ --year 2018 \\ --beam 1 \\ --model_dir lhc_model \\ --compensation none \\ --three_bpm_method \\ --coupling_method 1 \\ --outputdir measured_optics In this case, the output files from harpy are automatically handled and put into a subfolder named lin_files inside of the specified outputdir . The rest is done and output as seen above.","title":"Optics Analysis"},{"location":"packages/pylhc/about/","text":"PyLHC Tools \u00b6 This package is a collection of useful scripts and tools for the Optics Measurements and Corrections group (OMC) at CERN.

The parametrizing of simulations and submission can be done very similarly to job_submitter through Python, also by calling the main function of autosix with the desired parameters. SixTrack SEEDS As the loop over seeds is handled by SixDesk , you need to set FIRSTSEED and LASTSEED to None or 0 to deactivate this loop. Otherwise, a %SEEDRAN placeholder is required in your mask, which needs to be present after filling in the variables (see example below). Output Directories Unlike with job_submitter , the output directory of the HTCondor job is not automatically transferred to the workspace. To have access to this data, you will need to specify different output directories in your mask manually, e.g. using strings containing the variable placeholders. from pathlib import Path from pylhc_submitter import autosix if __name__ == \"__main__\" : autosix . main ( working_directory = Path ( \"/afs/cern.ch/work/u/user/sixdeskbase\" ), mask = Path ( \"my_madx.mask\" ), # contains parameters used in replace_dict python = Path ( \"/afs/cern.ch/work/u/user/my_venv/bin/python\" ), ignore_twissfail_check = False , # if script prints 'check if twiss failed' or so replace_dict = dict ( # Part of the sixdesk-environment: TURNS = 100_000 , AMPMIN = 4 , AMPMAX = 30 , AMPSTEP = 2 , ANGLES = 11 , # Examples for mask: BEAM = [ 1 , 4 ], TUNE = [ 62.29 , 62.30 , 62.31 , 62.31 ], OUTPUT = \"/afs/cern.ch/work/u/user/study_output/\" , SEED = \"%SEEDRAN\" , # put '%SEEDRAN' in the mask & let sixdesk handle this loop ), jobid_mask = \"B %(BEAM)d -QX %(TUNE)s \" , # unlock=True, # resubmit=True, # ssh='lxplus.cern.ch', ) AutoSix is not only able to run MAD-X masks, but also Python scripts using cpymad .

B2 = 0. ; twiss ; sixtrack , cavall , radius = 0.017 ; Python masks using cpymad can do the same task with: from cpymad.madx import Madx madx = Madx () # setup your study madx . globals [ \"VRF400\" ] = 8 if madx . globals [ \"NRJ\" ] < 5000 else 16 madx . globals [ \"LAGRF400.B1\" ] = 0.5 madx . globals [ \"LAGRF400.B2\" ] = 0. madx . twiss () # used by sixtrack madx . command . sixtrack ( cavall = True , radius = 0.017 ) What Happens After Submitting \u00b6 Upon running the script, the Jobs.tfs file is created similarly to job_submitter , and the following stages are run per job: create_jobs : create workspace, fill sysenv, sixdeskenv and mask. initialize_workspace : initialize workspace from the env-files. submit_mask : submit job to HTCondor from filled mask. ( interrupt ) check_input : check if sixdesk input is complete. submit_sixtrack : submit sixdesk jobs to HTCondor . ( interrupt ) check_sixtrack_output : check if all sixdesk jobs are completed. sixdb_load : create database and load jobs output. sixdb_cmd : calculate DA from database data. post_process : extract data from database, write into .tfs files and plot. final : announce every stage has completed. To keep track of the stages, they are written into a stages_completed.txt file in the autosix\\_output directory in the workspaces. Stages that are written in this file are assumed to be done and will be skipped. To rerun a stage, delete its entry and that of all following stages in the stages_completed.txt file and start your run anew. Execution Order The stages are ran independently of each job, meaning different jobs can be at different stages. For instance, if one job has all data for the six_db analysis already, but the others are still running on Sixdesk , the check_sixtrack_output stage will fail for these jobs but continue for the job that is ready. Because the stages after submit_mask and submit_sixtrack need only be ran after the jobs on HTCondor are completed, they will interrupt execution if previous stages have successfully finished. To have AutoSix continue its work, check your scheduler via condor_q and run your script again after everything is done. It will pick up where it left as written in the stages_completed.txt file. Custom sixdesk envs While most studies should be fine with the input options given, there is the possibility to manually adapt the sixdeskenv and sysenv files before workspace initialization by using the stop_workspace_init flag. This will not reset automatically and one will have to remove the switch again to continue. Polar Plots For the creation of polar plots, the function pylhc_submitter.sixdesk_tools.post_process_da.plot_polar is available. It is used for the basic polar plotting in the post_process stage, but provides more customization features if called manually.

The parametrizing of simulations and submission can be done very similarly to job_submitter through Python, also by calling the main function of autosix with the desired parameters. SixTrack SEEDS As the loop over seeds is handled by SixDesk , you need to set FIRSTSEED and LASTSEED to None or 0 to deactivate this loop. Otherwise, a %SEEDRAN placeholder is required in your mask, which needs to be present after filling in the variables (see example below). Output Directories Unlike with job_submitter , the output directory of the HTCondor job is not automatically transferred to the workspace. To have access to this data, you will need to specify different output directories in your mask manually, e.g. using strings containing the variable placeholders. from pathlib import Path from pylhc_submitter import autosix if __name__ == \"__main__\" : autosix . main ( working_directory = Path ( \"/afs/cern.ch/work/u/user/sixdeskbase\" ), mask = Path ( \"my_madx.mask\" ), # contains parameters used in replace_dict python = Path ( \"/afs/cern.ch/work/u/user/my_venv/bin/python\" ), ignore_twissfail_check = False , # if script prints 'check if twiss failed' or so replace_dict = dict ( # Part of the sixdesk-environment: TURNS = 100_000 , AMPMIN = 4 , AMPMAX = 30 , AMPSTEP = 2 , ANGLES = 11 , # Examples for mask: BEAM = [ 1 , 4 ], TUNE = [ 62.29 , 62.30 , 62.31 , 62.31 ], OUTPUT = \"/afs/cern.ch/work/u/user/study_output/\" , SEED = \"%SEEDRAN\" , # put '%SEEDRAN' in the mask & let sixdesk handle this loop ), jobid_mask = \"B %(BEAM)d -QX %(TUNE)s \" , # unlock=True, # resubmit=True, # ssh='lxplus.cern.ch', ) AutoSix is not only able to run MAD-X masks, but also Python scripts using cpymad . Requirement for the latter is to provide the as executable the path to a Python binary with cpymad and all relevant packages installed in the appropiate environment. In theory, any kind of mask is possible, given the correct executable is provided and the Sixtrack output files created.

As we will see later on, other methods methods require all parameter values to be written down while the pythonic way allows for an easier and clearer definition of the parameter space. The parametrizing of simulations and submission to HTCondor through Python is as simple as calling the main function of the submitter with the desired parameters. See below: import numpy as np from pylhc_submitter.job_submitter import main as htcondor_submit if __name__ == \"__main__\" : htcondor_submit ( executable = \"madx\" , # default pointing to the latest MAD-X on afs mask = \"my_madx.mask\" , # template to fill and execute MAD-X on replace_dict = dict ( # parameters to look for and replace in the template file BEAM = [ 1 , 2 ], TUNEX = np . linspace ( 62.3 , 62.32 , 11 ) . tolist (), TUNEY = np . linspace ( 60.31 , 60.33 , 11 ) . tolist (), ), jobid_mask = \"b %(BEAM)d .qx %(TUNEX)s .qy %(TUNEY)s \" , # naming of the submitted jobfiles working_directory = \"/afs/cern.ch/work/u/username/study.tune_sweep\" , # outputs jobflavour = \"workday\" , # htcondor flavour ) Starting Studies from a Config File \u00b6 The same can also be achieved by specifying the previously called parameters in a config.ini file. It is worth noting that with any submission, the job_submitter will create such a file. See below the equivalent config.ini of the above Python example: [DEFAULT] executable=\"madx\" mask=\"my_madx.mask\" working_directory=\"/afs/cern.ch/work/u/username/study.tune_sweep\" replace_dict={ \"BEAM\": [1, 2], \"TUNEX\": [62.3, 62.302, 62.304, 62.306, 62.308, 62.31, 62.312, 62.314, 62.316, 62.318, 62.32], \"TUNEY\": [60.31, 60.312, 60.314, 60.316, 60.318, 60.32, 60.322, 60.324, 60.326, 60.328, 60.33], } jobid_mask=\"b%(BEAM)d.qx%(TUNEX)s.qy%(TUNEY)s\" jobflavour=\"workday\" The jobs are then started by calling the submitter on this file from the command line: python -m pylhc_submitter.job_submitter --entry_cfg config.ini Starting Studies from the Command Line \u00b6 Users Beware While doing so is possible, using a simple command line call is discouraged. As we will see in the example below, this method is not as clear as the previous ones, and prone to errors. It is possible to skip the creation of a Python or a config.ini file completely when submitting, by providing parameters through the replace_dict flag at the command line. The above examples would be done through a (very lengthy) command line call as below: python -m pylhc_submitter.job_submitter --executable madx --mask my_madx.mask --working_directory /afs/cern.ch/work/u/username/study.tune_sweep --replace_dict \"{'BEAM': [1, 2], 'TUNEX': [62.3, 62.302, 62.304, 62.306, 62.308, 62.31, 62.312, 62.314, 62.316, 62.318, 62.32], 'TUNEY': [60.31, 60.312, 60.314, 60.316, 60.318, 60.32, 60.322, 60.324, 60.326, 60.328, 60.33]}\" --jobid_mask b% ( BEAM ) d.qx% ( TUNEX ) s.qy% ( TUNEY ) s --jobflavour workday Starting Studies with Mask Strings \u00b6 Instead of using a mask file, job_submitter can also use a string as input for the executable. This can prove useful if the executable has a number of variable input parameters, i.e. executable --param1 X --param2 Y . A simple mask string call using the config.ini input to the pylhc-submitter would look like this: [DEFAULT] executable=\"expr\" mask=\"%(SUMMAND1)s + %(SUMMAND2)s > Outputdata/result.txt\" working_directory=\"/afs/cern.ch/work/u/username/study.addition\" replace_dict={\"SUMMAND1\": [1, 2, 3, 4], \"SUMMAND2\": [6, 7, 8, 9]} run_local=True num_processes=4 Note that again, the user has to take care that the required results are saved in the correct job_output_dir . The mask string can be a more complicated multiline string, executing multiple commands. Example Multiline Config File [DEFAULT] executable=None mask=\"madx < Job%(SEED)s.madx\\n python -m analysis.main --method %(METHOD)s\" working_directory=\"/afs/cern.ch/work/u/username/study.multiline\" replace_dict={\"SEED\"= [1, 2, 3, 4], \"METHOD\"= ['fast', 'slow', 'new']} run_local=True num_processes=4 What Happens After Submitting \u00b6 When submitting, the job_submitter determines jobs to be submitted to HTCondor through the inner product of the replace_dict : in our example each possible combination of the 3 given parameters. The script will issue several logging statements to keep the user updated, but here is what happens behind the scenes. A folder structure is created in the given working directory , in which one will find: A Job.tfs file, a global summary dataframe in which each row corresponds to a set of parameters filled in for one submitted job: The first column, JobId , is either numbering of the jobs or - in our case - the filled in jobid_mask , The next columns are the given parameters, here: BEAM , TUNEX and TUNEY . They contain the value filled in the respective job-instance of said row, The JobDirectory , JobFile and ShellScript columns respectively contain the path to the job directory, the name of the filled mask file and the name of the script which are used to run the job. A queuehtc.sub file, the HTCondor submission file used, which tells HTCondor the paths to all the ShellScripts to run. Many sub-directories named according to the jobid_mask , one per job, each with: A ShellScript .sh , which contains commands to create the job_output_dir and the madx command to run the script, A JobFile which is the original mask , parameter values filled in. Dry Runs In case one runs the submitter with the dryrun flag, the execution stops here and prepared files are accessible, but nothing is sent to the HTCondor scheduler. One can use this option to perform a thorough check before using condor_submit on the created submission file queuehtc.sub . Number of Jobs As job_submitter creates a job for each combination in the inner product of the replace_dict parameters, the number of jobs can easily get high. In our example case, we are submitting beam * tunex * tuney = 2 * 11 * 11 = 242 jobs. It is worth noting that currently the maximum number of jobs to be submitted to HTCondor is set to 100k . After submitting our tune sweep studies, we can check the status of our jobs via the condor_q (unless running locally). The output should look something like this: condor_q : Shows the jobs in the condor queue. When all jobs are done running, the htcondor.<jobid>.err , htcondor.<jobid>.log and htcondor.<jobid>.out files for the respective job are transferred back to the appropriate directories. Finally, for each job the job_output_dir , here containing the .twiss.tfs file, will be transfered back as well, ready for post-processing. Checking for and Resubmitting Failed Jobs \u00b6 To see if and which Jobs have failed, the same command as above can be rerun using resume_jobs and dryrun flags (or use them as parameters set to True ). By default, Jobs are classified as successful if the specified job_output_dir is present. To resubmit the failed jobs to HTCondor , simply rerun the call and omit the dryrun flag or set its parameter to False . Refining the Resubmission To further refine the resubmission, the script can also check for the presence of files in the job_output_dir by using the check_files flag. In the case of our tune sweep example, this would look like check_files=[\"*.twiss.tfs\"] . Pitfalls and Hints \u00b6 The ssh Option When using the ssh option, the working directory needs to be accessible from both the local machine as well as the ssh server. In this case, ssh is only used for the final command submitting the jobs to HTCondor . Running Locally The run_local flag allows parallelizing jobs on your local machine through multiprocessing. This is only recommended for short jobs and for a small number of jobs, as the stress on your machine can be intense. The num_processes option allows to specify how many concurrent processes will run, by default 4.","title":"Job Submitter"},{"location":"packages/pylhcsubmitter/job_submitter/#pylhc-submitter","text":"See the API documentation for a detailed description of the code and the different parameters.

The script will issue several logging statements to keep the user updated, but here is what happens behind the scenes. A folder structure is created in the given working directory , in which one will find: A Job.tfs file, a global summary dataframe in which each row corresponds to a set of parameters filled in for one submitted job: The first column, JobId , is either numbering of the jobs or - in our case - the filled in jobid_mask , The next columns are the given parameters, here: BEAM , TUNEX and TUNEY . They contain the value filled in the respective job-instance of said row, The JobDirectory , JobFile and ShellScript columns respectively contain the path to the job directory, the name of the filled mask file and the name of the script which are used to run the job. A queuehtc.sub file, the HTCondor submission file used, which tells HTCondor the paths to all the ShellScripts to run. Many sub-directories named according to the jobid_mask , one per job, each with: A ShellScript .sh , which contains commands to create the job_output_dir and the madx command to run the script, A JobFile which is the original mask , parameter values filled in. Dry Runs In case one runs the submitter with the dryrun flag, the execution stops here and prepared files are accessible, but nothing is sent to the HTCondor scheduler. One can use this option to perform a thorough check before using condor_submit on the created submission file queuehtc.sub . Number of Jobs As job_submitter creates a job for each combination in the inner product of the replace_dict parameters, the number of jobs can easily get high. In our example case, we are submitting beam * tunex * tuney = 2 * 11 * 11 = 242 jobs. It is worth noting that currently the maximum number of jobs to be submitted to HTCondor is set to 100k . After submitting our tune sweep studies, we can check the status of our jobs via the condor_q (unless running locally). The output should look something like this: condor_q : Shows the jobs in the condor queue. When all jobs are done running, the htcondor.<jobid>.err , htcondor.<jobid>.log and htcondor.<jobid>.out files for the respective job are transferred back to the appropriate directories. Finally, for each job the job_output_dir , here containing the .twiss.tfs file, will be transfered back as well, ready for post-processing.","title":"What Happens After Submitting"},{"location":"packages/pylhcsubmitter/job_submitter/#checking-for-and-resubmitting-failed-jobs","text":"To see if and which Jobs have failed, the same command as above can be rerun using resume_jobs and dryrun flags (or use them as parameters set to True ). By default, Jobs are classified as successful if the specified job_output_dir is present. To resubmit the failed jobs to HTCondor , simply rerun the call and omit the dryrun flag or set its parameter to False . Refining the Resubmission To further refine the resubmission, the script can also check for the presence of files in the job_output_dir by using the check_files flag.

In case you need to unmount these sudo fusermount -u ~/mnt/user sudo fusermount -u ~/mnt/nfs sudo fusermount -u ~/mnt/eos Running GUIs Locally \u00b6 To use the KMod GUI or the KnobPanel in the Beta-Beat GUI , it is required to be on the TN , as they need to connect to LSA . If you are in the GPN but not on the TN , you will need to tunnel through some machines. First, install the program sshuttle , which should be available in your package manager. Then, run this command in a terminal and leave it open: sshuttle -vr <username>@cs-ccr-dev2 172 .18.0.0/16 All traffic related to the technical network will be redirected through the cs-ccr-dev2 machine which has access to both networks. In case it isn't available, the other cs-ccr-devX machines can be used. Configuring Gitlab CI to Automatically Pull into AFS \u00b6 If you are programming locally, but also want to have a copy on AFS , either because your colleges are not comfortable with Gitlab or you need the code for other scripts that you are running on lxplus or similar, here is how: Create Service Account \u00b6 Security Risk! We will be creating a new account, so you do not have to add the password of your main account to your Gitlab repository : this would be a security risk! Admittedly, it is a low one if everything is done correctly, but just in case something goes wrong or leaks, you can just delete this account . Also, you can give this account only the rights necessary to write to AFS in the first place and do not risk that anyone can access other sensible information. 1. Create a new service account, via the CERN account management , of length 8. You need at least 8 characters to mask that name in Gitlab (if you want to do so), but on the other hand, there is a warning, that AFS cannot handle names longer than 8. So exactly 8 seems to be the sweetspot. If you do not care about masking the name (it is not as important as masking the password, see below) you can go shorter. 2. Set a password of length \u2265 8 containing only [a-zA-Z0-9+/@:] . We want to hide the password later in gitlab, and this is only possible if its >= 8 characters long and only contains Base64 characters as well as @: . You can go as long as you want. Better make this 15 characters long at least. 3. Activate the AFS service for the newly created account. Setup AFS folder \u00b6 Steps to be done on AFS : 4. Clone your git into your AFS destination. It is important here to you use the right link to set this up, depending on whether you want your repository to be private or public. Go to your Gitlab repository page and click onto the blue clone button on the right. If it is okay for your repo to be publicly accessible you can use the HTTPS url. If you want to set it up privately you will need to clone with the KRB5 url, so Kerberos can be later used to authenticate your service account. ( See also below for giving it rights to the repository.) 5. Run: find . -type d -exec fs sa {} ACCOUNTNAME rlidw \\; Run within the repository or replace . with the repository name! Replace ACCOUNTNAME with the name of your Service Account. This will give read/write access to this repository to the service account. Just giving these rights to the top-folder will not work, as it does not propagate to subfolders automatically. A possible other way would be to create an empty folder and give writing rights to that one to the service account and then login to lxplus with the service account and clone the repository directly with that account. The latter is a good test to see if everything worked correctly anyway. Do not forget, if you have set up the repository with Kerberos authentification, to adapt your .ssh/config to delegate the credentials. Repeated for easy copying: find . -type d -exec fs sa {} ACCOUNTNAME rlidw \\; Setup Git \u00b6 Steps to be done on your Gitlab repository: 6. Give your service account access rights or set the repository to public. The former can be done under Members , the latter under Settings \u2192 General \u2192 Visibility, project features, permissions . If you set it up to be a private repository, you need to have cloned the repository with the KRB5 url ( see above ). 7. Add SERVICE_ACCOUNT_USERNAME and SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PASSWORD variables. This is done in Settings \u2192 CI/CD \u2192 Variables . Obviously the values of the variables will be the username and password of your newly created service account respectively. These variables will be used in the next step in the YAML. For obvious reasons, DO NOT WRITE THE PASSWORD IN CLEAR TEXT INTO THE YAML . Security Risk! MAKE SURE AT LEAST THE SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PASSWORD VARIABLE IS SET TO Masked !!! 8. Add a new stage to your .gitlab-ci.yml file, or create a new one. stages : - afs_pull afs : stage : afs_pull image : gitlab-registry.cern.ch/linuxsupport/cc7-base before_script : - yum install -y openssh-clients - mkdir -p ~/.ssh - 'echo \"lxplus ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDTA/5AzXgbkSapknIPDoEePTM1PzIBSiyDnpZihdDXKzm8UdXxCDJLUVjBwc1JfBjnaXPEeBKZDuozDss/m98m5qQu+s2Dks000V8cUFTU+BFotzRWX0jWSBpmzse0477b40X2XCPqX0Cqfx9yHdkuMlyF0kJRxXgsGTcwzwbmvqNHJdHHYJJz93hGpBhYMREcDN5VOxXz6Ack3X7xfF29xaC91oOAqq75O11LXF5Y4kAeN9kDG8o6Zsqk4c5at5aqWqzZfnnVtGjhkgU2Mt5aKwptaFMe0Z3ys/zZM4SnsE9NfompnnWsiKk2y09UvrbzuYPWLt43Fp3+IFqRJvBX\" > ~/.ssh/known_hosts' - 'echo -e \"Host *\\n\\tGSSAPIDelegateCredentials yes\\n\\tGSSAPITrustDNS yes\\n\\n\" > ~/.ssh/config' script : - echo \"${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PASSWORD}\" | kinit -f ${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_USERNAME}@CERN.CH - klist - ssh ${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_USERNAME}@lxplus \"cd PATH_TO_YOUR_AFS && git checkout master && git pull\" only : - master Info Replace PATH_TO_YOUR_AFS with the path to your AFS folder . Do NOT replace SERVICE_ACCOUNT_USERNAME and SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PASSWORD . These will be inserted by gitlab's CI !. More Info on the YAML The .yml was copied and adapted from the acc-models-lhc repository with some changes. In general, a Docker image is loaded, openssh is installed and a Kerberos token is created. With this token it is now possible to ssh to lxplus as the service account, go into the desired directory and checkout the repository. git checkout master is only performed in case someone changed the branch on AFS (which should not happen, do not touch). Image : The image gitlab-registry.cern.ch/linuxsupport/cc7-base used is the default Cern Centos 7 docker image, provided by Linux @ CERN .

We will be creating a new account, so you do not have to add the password of your main account to your Gitlab repository : this would be a security risk! Admittedly, it is a low one if everything is done correctly, but just in case something goes wrong or leaks, you can just delete this account . Also, you can give this account only the rights necessary to write to AFS in the first place and do not risk that anyone can access other sensible information. 1. Create a new service account, via the CERN account management , of length 8. You need at least 8 characters to mask that name in Gitlab (if you want to do so), but on the other hand, there is a warning, that AFS cannot handle names longer than 8. So exactly 8 seems to be the sweetspot. If you do not care about masking the name (it is not as important as masking the password, see below) you can go shorter. 2. Set a password of length \u2265 8 containing only [a-zA-Z0-9+/@:] . We want to hide the password later in gitlab, and this is only possible if its >= 8 characters long and only contains Base64 characters as well as @: . You can go as long as you want.

Go to your Gitlab repository page and click onto the blue clone button on the right. If it is okay for your repo to be publicly accessible you can use the HTTPS url. If you want to set it up privately you will need to clone with the KRB5 url, so Kerberos can be later used to authenticate your service account. ( See also below for giving it rights to the repository.) 5. Run: find . -type d -exec fs sa {} ACCOUNTNAME rlidw \\; Run within the repository or replace . with the repository name! Replace ACCOUNTNAME with the name of your Service Account. This will give read/write access to this repository to the service account. Just giving these rights to the top-folder will not work, as it does not propagate to subfolders automatically. A possible other way would be to create an empty folder and give writing rights to that one to the service account and then login to lxplus with the service account and clone the repository directly with that account. The latter is a good test to see if everything worked correctly anyway.

More Info on the YAML The .yml was copied and adapted from the acc-models-lhc repository with some changes. In general, a Docker image is loaded, openssh is installed and a Kerberos token is created. With this token it is now possible to ssh to lxplus as the service account, go into the desired directory and checkout the repository. git checkout master is only performed in case someone changed the branch on AFS (which should not happen, do not touch). Image : The image gitlab-registry.cern.ch/linuxsupport/cc7-base used is the default Cern Centos 7 docker image, provided by Linux @ CERN .
