Acts as a landing page so that the `Python Packages` tab doesn't land directly on `omc3` content, which is counter-intuitive.
Can have a short description of what the tab is about, that omc3 is our main analysis package and that we have other packages.
Maybe a bullet list like in the BetaBeat GUI about page, with redirects to the proper pages, could be nice.
