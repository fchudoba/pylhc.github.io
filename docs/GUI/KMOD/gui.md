# The Kmod GUI

The Kmod GUI provides functionality to perform [K-Modulation](../../general/methods.md#K-Modulation) either as a full IP trim or through an individual magnet circuit, in the form of a graphical interface.
It also has the ability to extract and analyze data from previous trims.

This site will guide you through the GUI's layout and functionality.
For starters, see [here](running.md) about running the GUI.
