# Auto Trim

The `AutoTrim` functionality combines all existing tasks in the Kmod GUI.
The user can choose tasks to do for each IP.

The AutoTrim then executes all the trimming tasks and analyzing tasks in the best order possible to optimize the whole k-modulation process.
The user can now input the parameter once to do the k-modulation and other analyzation tasks on many IP's.
The results and current status of each process is displayed on the main panel.
The AutoTrim provides something like a pipeline of many k-modulations and their analyzing tasks.
